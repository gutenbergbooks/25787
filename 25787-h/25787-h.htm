<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>INTRODUCING AN AIRSHIP AND COUNT ZEPT</h3>
</div>

<p>This story, which is an account of the peculiar
and marvelous adventures by which two
Canadian boys&mdash;Norman Grant and Roy
Moulton&mdash;achieved a sudden fame in the
Arctic wilderness of the great Northwest, had
its beginning in the thriving city of Calgary.
The exact time was the big day of the celebrated
&#8220;Stampede,&#8221; Calgary&#8217;s famous civic
celebration. It was in July and among the
many events that had drawn thousands of
people to the new Northwestern metropolis,
Norman and Roy were on the program as aviators
and exhibitors of their new aeroplane.
</p>
<p>These young men were born in Calgary and
had lived eighteen years in that city. Since
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
this almost covered the period of Calgary&#8217;s
growth from a trading post to a modern city,
each young man had a knowledge of the wilderness
and its romance that other boys could get
only from history. This meant that they knew
plainsmen, scouts, ranchmen, cowboys, hunters,
trappers, and even Indians as personal friends.
It meant also that they had a real knowledge
of the prairies, the woods and even of the mountains.
Their knowledge of these men and the
land in which they lived was personal and did
not come from the fanciful narratives of books
of adventure.
</p>
<p>Each boy was the son of a mechanic, men
who had come into the Province of Alberta with
the first railroads. And each boy was educated
in all that a grammar school affords. The
picturesque romance of the Northwest having
been a part of the life of each, it might have
been supposed that the ambitions of the two
lads would have run toward mining or ranch
life or even toward the inviting work of hunters
or trappers.
</p>
<p>To the gratification of their fathers, however,
they fell in with the modern movement
and turned toward mechanics. When the
furore for aeronautics reached even far-away
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
Calgary, the boys found themselves passionately
absorbed in all airship discoveries.
Mr. Grant&#8217;s position as a division mechanic
of a great trunk railroad, and Mr. Moulton&#8217;s
&#8220;Electrical Supply Factory,&#8221; gave the boys
their starting point. Later, in Mr. Moulton&#8217;s
factory, an outbuilding was appropriated and
in this place, with the approval and assistance
of their fathers, the two boys finally completed
an airship. This was but a spur to a renewed
effort, and within a year, the boys attending
school meanwhile, they finished their improved
aeroplane. It was named the &#8220;<i>Gitchie Manitou</i>&#8221;
or &#8220;Spirit of the Wind&#8221;&mdash;words taken
from the Cree Indians.
</p>
<p>The original ideas that resulted in this ingenious
contrivance came mainly from the boys
themselves. Yet they neglected no suggestions
that they could find in the latest aeronautical
journals. This wonderful machine was only
locally known, but when the citizens of Calgary
planned their local celebration, known as the
&#8220;Stampede,&#8221; there was knowledge among the
promoters, of the just completed &#8220;<i>Gitchie
Manitou</i>.&#8221; It was fitting that this modern invention
should be shown in contrast with all
that was being collected to exhibit the past,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
so an arrangement was made with the young
aviators to give a daily flight in the new airship.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It really isn&#8217;t made for work of this kind,&#8221;
argued Norman to his companion when the
suggestion was made to them, &#8220;but if it&#8217;ll work
in the winter in the wind and snow, as we&#8217;ve
planned, I reckon we ought to be able to put it
over in the park.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;ll work all right,&#8221; responded Roy.
&#8220;But what if it does? I never quite figured out
that we were to turn ourselves into showmen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; interrupted Grant at once.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to show your goods first. It&#8217;s just
the place where we may meet people who will
understand what it&#8217;s good for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And even then what are we going to do?&#8221;
asked Roy. &#8220;Sell it to some mail or stage contractor?
To some one who works in the blizzard?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The other boy shook his head: &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know,&#8221; he answered slowly, &#8220;but it&#8217;s certainly
going to come in handy for some one. I don&#8217;t
know of any other machine that you can run in
a snowstorm or that would be any good up here
in the wilderness when the bad weather comes
on. They&#8217;re not going to pay us much for risking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
our necks, but I&#8217;m in favor of making a
contract, just to see if some one doesn&#8217;t come
along who&#8217;ll understand it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; suggested Roy with a smile, &#8220;I
suppose all that&#8217;ll be left for us to do will be to
sell it and go to work on another one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered young Grant
slowly, &#8220;there aren&#8217;t many aviators &#8217;round
here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We might get a job running it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The other boy&#8217;s eyes sparkled. &#8220;That settles
it,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;Let&#8217;s sign up and do
the best we can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Calgary is to-day the little Chicago of the
great Northwest. In the heart of it one may
find the last of the old-time frontier life, while
around and over this is all that makes a modern
city. At this time the civic pride of the city had
prompted its citizens to prepare an exhibit
typical of that part of the country which,
throughout Canada and the States, was also described
in placards and vivid pictures as the
&#8220;Stampede.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The main reason for this was that in the
pushing westward of the refinements of civilization
it was perhaps the last thing of its kind
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
that could be celebrated on such a scale on this
continent. The modern Provincial Fairground,
lying well within the city limits of Calgary,
was selected as the site of the performance.
Here, when the &#8220;Stampede&#8221; finally took place,
thousands of people made their way from the
Western States and northwestern Canada.
There were among them many theatrical producers,
moving picture operators, and others
especially interested in such a unique exhibit,
from the far East. All could foresee possibilities
that might never again be presented.
</p>
<p>It would bring together the last of the plainsmen,
scouts, trappers, and many others who
had been engaged in the conquest of the wilderness.
This meant a strange mixture of the men
who had made possible the romance of both
western America and the wide Canadian Northwest.
There were to be full-blood Indians,
half-breeds, and that curious mixture of foreigners
who had made their way through the fur-bearing
North by way of frozen Hudson&#8217;s
Bay. The men would be there who had traveled
through pathless woods, who had found
and named rivers and who had scaled unknown
mountain peaks&mdash;many of them in the leather
coats and moccasins of old days.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>Where it was possible, these survivors of a
period now gone were to bring with them the
weapons of the frontier and the implements of
camp life. There were to be stage coaches and
freight wagons of the prairies, relics of the trail
and the paraphernalia of the frontier.
</p>
<p>The program of the Stampede included the
exhibition of these people and their old-time
life as well as it could be reproduced. Horses
noted for their viciousness, Mexican bulls especially
selected for their savageness, and the
untamed range cayuse, were to exhibit the prowess
of the horsemen. With these, the Indians
and their families were to copy the life of the
woods in the tepee and the movements on the
trail.
</p>
<p>Having concluded a contract to become participants
in this unique affair, Norman Grant
and Roy Moulton developed an interest in it
that they did not know they possessed. To
them most of it was an old story. But, having
superintended the erection of an aerodrome on
the edge of the open field inside the race track,
they were surprised at the interest they began
to take in the many curious people who soon
began to arrive and install themselves in tents
and cabins.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>The exhibition was to last one week. On
Monday morning of Stampede week, while
the two boys were engaged in installing the
aeroplane, Roy suddenly disappeared. He was
gone over a half hour and when he returned,
flushed with some new enthusiasm, he found
his chum Norman much disgruntled. The machine
had been set up before Roy left and he
had stolen away while Norman was working
with the engine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything all right?&#8221; asked Roy a little
guiltily as he observed his companion seated
on a box, a half scowl on his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess so,&#8221; answered Grant without a
smile. &#8220;At least, I did all I could, <i>alone</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think there was much to do,&#8221; exclaimed
Roy apologetically. &#8220;I had something
I wanted to do&mdash;I&#8217;d have asked you to go,
but I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d care. I&#8217;ve been to
see those La Biche rivermen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s La Biche, and what rivermen?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you know, Lac la Biche, way up country,
where the rivermen come from.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about &#8217;em&mdash;you
mean &#8216;scow men&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; answered Roy, taking off his
coat. &#8220;I wanted to see &#8217;em and I knew they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
got in last night. I&#8217;ve met all kind of Indians,
but these old boatmen don&#8217;t get down this way
very often.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&#8217;d you think I didn&#8217;t care?&#8221; asked
the other boy. &#8220;If you mean a real old batteau
steersman, I never saw one either. I
reckon I&#8217;d have gone a few hundred yards to
see one of &#8217;em if he&#8217;s the real goods. Since the
steamboats came in, I thought they&#8217;d all played
out. Are these fellows half-breeds or full-bloods?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make any mistake about &#8217;em!&#8221; responded
Roy eagerly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen all kinds of
Indians but these are some I never did see.
They&#8217;re all right, too. If there&#8217;s anything
about a canoe or a flatboat that they don&#8217;t
know, I guess nobody can tell it to &#8217;em.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll have a fine time doing any paddling
or steering around here in this race
track,&#8221; suggested Norman gruffly. &#8220;How are
they goin&#8217; to show &#8217;em off? But what do they
look like?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not wearing Indian togs much,&#8221;
explained Roy, taking a seat by his friend,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ve never seen real old full-blood Indian
rivermen, but I know these fellows look
like &#8217;em. But I&#8217;d change their names if I was
going to put &#8217;em on the program.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t sound Indian enough?&#8221; suggested
Norman. &#8220;Full-bloods never do seem to have
real Indian names. Seems like all the loafin&#8217;
half-breeds take the best names.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway,&#8221; went on Roy, &#8220;these men are
John Martin, or old &#8216;Moosetooth,&#8217; and William
La Biche.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Moosetooth and La Biche are all right,&#8221;
commented Norman. &#8220;Do they wear shoes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; explained Roy, &#8220;they&#8217;re in moccasins&mdash;plain
mooseskin wrapped around the
ankles. You&#8217;d know &#8217;em by that. And they
both carry the Cree tobacco pouch, with the long
tassels hanging out of their hip pocket&mdash;so
they can find the pouch in the dark, I suppose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And black Stetson hats?&#8221; added Norman,
&#8220;with big silver buttons all around the leather
band?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; answered the other boy. &#8220;But
you ought to see their arms. Neither one of
&#8217;em is big, but if you saw their arms you&#8217;d
know how they swing those twenty-foot steering
oars. I got a hankerin&#8217; after those fellows.
Any man who can stand in the stern of
an old Hudson Bay Company &#8216;sturgeon head&#8217;
and steer it through fifteen hundred miles
o&#8217; rivers and lakes, clear down to the Arctic
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
Ocean, and then walk back if necessary, has
got it all over the kind of Indians I know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Norman looked at him a few moments and
then got up and motioned him out of the aerodrome.
He swung the big doors together,
locked them, and then exclaimed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care to get excited over every old
greasy Indian that comes along but lead me
to old Moosetooth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Roy, who was well pleased over so easily
placating his chum, at once led the way around
the race track and through the fringe of tepees,
tents and other shelters being erected for the
housing of the fast gathering arrivals. At last
he stood before a group of mooseskin tepees
in which were gathered several families of Cree
Indians. These people had been brought from
the present famous Indian encampment on the
shores of Lac la Biche, just south of Athabasca
River, where it turns on its long northward
journey to the Arctic Ocean.
</p>
<p>It is the men of this region who are sought
by the great fur companies, by adventurers and
sportsmen and by all those traffickers who use
the great riverway to the north. And it is from
them that the skilled canoe men and the experienced
flatboat steersmen are selected for the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
conduct of the precious flotillas on these northern
waters.
</p>
<p>From Lac la Biche the veterans are called
each year when the ice is gone out of the Athabasca,
to take charge of the great Hudson&#8217;s Bay
Company&#8217;s fleet of batteaux whose descent of
the river means life to those who pass their
winters in the far north. These things both
boys knew, and hence their interest in Moosetooth
Martin and old man La Biche.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here they are!&#8221; announced young Moulton
as, without hesitation, he made his way
through the litter of the little camp where the
women were already cooking the inevitable
bannock.
</p>
<p>Norman greeted each man and welcomed them
to the camp. The Indians were beyond middle
age and the dark face of each was seamed with
wrinkles. Nothing in Moosetooth&#8217;s yellow
regular teeth warranted his name, however.
This might better have been applied to La
Biche, whose several missing teeth emphasized
his few remaining ones.
</p>
<p>The two men and others were squatted near
the fire, each smoking a short black pipe. Some
spoke English but there was little conversation.
The boys turned to examine a couple of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
rare birch-bark canoes and the camp itself, but
almost at once they were distracted by the
appearance of a new spectator in the group
already surrounding the camp.
</p>
<p>This was a young man, not much beyond the
two boys in age but older in expression. He
had a foreign look, and wore a small moustache.
Norman instantly noted that his face showed
mild traces of dissipation. The stranger was
tall and although slight in build seemed full
of energy and somewhat sinewy in body. His
clothes were distinctive and of a foreign cut.
He wore smart riding gloves, a carelessly
arranged but expensive necktie in which was
stuck a diamond studded horseshoe. He was
smoking a cigarette.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; he said to Norman. &#8220;Pretty
classy boats these, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; responded the boy, &#8220;and pretty rare
too. You don&#8217;t see many of these around any
more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought all the Indians used birch-bark
boats in the North,&#8221; commented the young man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No more!&#8221; explained Roy. &#8220;They ship
cedar boats up to Herschel Island now. I
haven&#8217;t seen one of these bark boats for years.
But these are the real stuff!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you live here?&#8221; asked the young man,
drawing on his cigarette.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Both of us have lived here all our lives,&#8221;
answered Roy, looking the unusual young man
over carefully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m a stranger,&#8221; resumed the young
man, proffering his cigarette case, which appeared
to be of gold and bore a crest on it.
When the boys declined he went on: &#8220;I&#8217;m
going to live here now, however. I&#8217;ve just
come from Paris. I&#8217;m Mr. Zept&#8217;s son. You
know him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The two boys straightened. Mr. Zept was
one of the richest and most active citizens of
Calgary. He was even ranked as a millionaire,
having made his money with the other big horse
ranchmen in that part of the world. He was
a close friend of Norman&#8217;s father and had
been especially active in organizing the Stampede.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course!&#8221; exclaimed Norman.
&#8220;Everyone knows Mr. Zept. He&#8217;s the big
man in this show. I&#8217;m glad to know you. I
am Norman Grant and my friend here is Roy
Moulton.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re the fellows who are going to
give the airship show,&#8221; responded the young
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
man with a marked interest. &#8220;I am glad to
meet you. I&#8217;m Paul Zept. I&#8217;m just through
school&mdash;in Paris. I&#8217;ve been living with my
grandfather. Now I&#8217;m going to live here. My
father wants me to go on one of his ranches. I
like horses but I don&#8217;t think I like ranches.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father has some fine ones,&#8221; suggested
Roy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; answered the young man,
&#8220;but I want to get out on the frontier. I
thought this was the frontier.&#8221; He smiled as
he turned to wave his hand toward the skyscrapers
and factory chimneys and suburban
homes near by on the hills. &#8220;But this doesn&#8217;t
look much like it. I want to get out in the
wilds&mdash;and that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m going.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what that means?&#8221; asked
Norman with a smile in turn. &#8220;Do you know
about the spoiled pork and bannock and mosquitoes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you mean the rough part,&#8221;
answered the young man. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never had
much of that but I want to try it. I want to get
beyond civilization. I want to get where I can
see things I can&#8217;t read about. I&#8217;m tired of
Paris and school and I want to see the real
wilderness.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gone!&#8221; interrupted Roy again with a
laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All gone?&#8221; asked the young man with a
peculiar look.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly all,&#8221; exclaimed Norman; &#8220;unless
you go a great ways from here. Unless,&#8221; he
continued, his smile broadening into a grin,
&#8220;you can arrange to go home with Moosetooth
here or La Biche.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; responded the young man as he lit
a new cigarette, &#8220;if that&#8217;s true I think I&#8217;m
going with them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His tone was so positive and so conclusive
that neither Norman nor Roy made any immediate
comment. Moved by politeness they asked
the young man if he would care to have a look
at the airship. While Norman explained something
about himself and his companion the three
young men made their way back to the aerodrome.
Before they reached it he had related
their own small adventures.
</p>
<p>Then young Zept had made them further
acquainted with himself. Like his father he
had been born in Austria and later had been
sent to school in Paris. There, as Norman and
Roy could see, he had received a more than
ordinary education, part of which, as the boys
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
afterwards learned, was devoted to music.
They also learned later that although not a
great singer he had a pleasing tenor voice.
</p>
<p>Paul told them himself that he had devoted
a great deal of time to horsemanship. This,
he explained, was doubtless due to the fact that
his father had always engaged in the raising
and selling of horses. The young man also
explained to the boys that he had not only
received the ordinary riding lessons but that
he had also been trained under Austrian and
Italian military riding masters. His interest
in the coming &#8220;Stampede&#8221; was due largely to
the exhibit of horsemanship that he expected
to see.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see why you wouldn&#8217;t like life on a
horse ranch,&#8221; commented Roy at last.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter!&#8221; responded the young man.
&#8220;I do like horses and I know it&#8217;s going to be a
jolly row with the governor but I&#8217;ve always
had my own way and I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll stop
me now. I think I&#8217;m going into the wilderness&mdash;even
if I have to go alone. I&#8217;ve been riding
horses all my life. Now I want to do something.
The governor wants me to go in for making
money. I want to <i>discover</i> something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again the two boys looked at each other without
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
knowing just what to say. Their new
acquaintance was certainly affable enough, but
his education and his foreign bearing put him
somewhat above the young men and they felt
a certain reticence in his presence. Finally,
as Norman unlocked the door of the aerodrome,
it occurred to him to say:
</p>
<p>&#8220;This wilderness idea is pretty fine at long
range or in books, but it seems to be like some
other things. If you&#8217;ve got the real hankering
for it, rotten food and all the mosquitoes in
the world won&#8217;t keep you from it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know it,&#8221; broke in the young
Austrian instantly, &#8220;but if we&#8217;re going to live
in the same town I might as well tell you that a
lot of people call me &#8216;Count Zept.&#8217; Of course
I&#8217;m not a &#8216;Count&#8217; and I don&#8217;t know why they
gave me the title, unless it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve never
been good for much. Now I&#8217;m going to get rid
of that handle to my name by showing my folks
and others that I can do something besides ride
horses. I&#8217;m going home with old Moosetooth
and La Biche and stay there long enough to
forget there&#8217;s a place like Paris.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>A CURIOUS STRANGER LEARNS THE OBJECT OF THE <i>Gitchie Manitou</i></h3>
</div>

<p>The announced flight of the young aviators
Monday afternoon was delayed until the hour
grew so late that this feature of the program
was postponed until the next day. It was the
old story of over-enthusiastic amateur assistants
who persisted in giving unsolicited aid
when the airship was being taken from the aerodrome.
A young man who thought the machine
had to be carried instead of being wheeled onto
the starting field sought to lift the rear truss
by means of the lateral rudder. In doing this,
he punctured the oiled silk plane. After a futile
attempt to sew the rent, Norman was forced to
ask the police to clear their enclosure. When
Mr. Zept, one of the committeemen, called and
learned of the situation, he advised a postponement
of the flight until the next afternoon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My son tells me,&#8221; remarked Mr. Zept as he
was about to leave the aerodrome, &#8220;that he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
had the pleasure of meeting you boys this morning.
I&#8217;m glad of it. I hope you&#8217;ll be friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a fine young man,&#8221; answered Norman.
&#8220;You ought to be proud of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All parents should be proud of their children,&#8221;
answered Mr. Zept with a sober face.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve tried to give Paul a good education and
I hope I&#8217;ve done the best for him. But I have
never seen much of him and, in a way,&#8221; he added
with a smile, &#8220;I hardly know him as well as I
do you boys.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s certainly enthusiastic,&#8221; remarked
Roy, &#8220;and&mdash;and impulsive,&#8221; he added, hesitatingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He really has some peculiar ideas,&#8221; commented
Mr. Zept. &#8220;But I suppose they&#8217;re natural.
I had peculiar ideas myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; suggested Norman, &#8220;he makes a
great deal out of things that are old stories to
us. If we didn&#8217;t live here and know the West
as well as we do, I suppose we would have the
same romantic ideas.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Zept was just making his departure, but
at this he paused.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he asked suddenly
and with some concern in his voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you know he&#8217;s determined to see the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
real wilderness,&#8221; laughed Roy. &#8220;He wants to
get a taste of the life the story books describe.
I told him it might not be such an appetizing
meal but I imagine he&#8217;s set on it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I believe,&#8221; answered Mr. Zept, &#8220;although
it isn&#8217;t what I had planned for him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; he added quickly, &#8220;you young
men know how little there is in indulging this
longing for wilderness adventure. I hope if you
have a chance you won&#8217;t fail to impress upon
Paul the facts as we know them. I want him
to live at home now, with his mother and me.
I&#8217;m afraid he&#8217;s been too long away from us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That evening the two young men could not
resist the temptation to visit the downtown
district where the hotels were crowded with
visitors and the city was resplendent with unusual
activity. Norman left Roy with some
friends at the King George Hotel and went
home at an early hour. When Roy called at
Norman&#8217;s house the next morning, on his way
to the Stampede Grounds, he spoke of some
new information he had picked up the night
before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I found out last night,&#8221; he began at once,
&#8220;that everything isn&#8217;t as sunshiny in the Zept
home as it might be. Our new friend, the Count,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
I was told by some friends, got a pretty early
start in the fast life of Paris. Mr. Zept wants
Paul to stay at home a while, as I get it, to
make some changes in him if he can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked Norman.
&#8220;But I can guess it&mdash;it&#8217;s in his face. And it
isn&#8217;t cigarettes either.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; answered Roy. &#8220;We call it booze
out here, but in the young man&#8217;s circle in Paris
I reckon it wouldn&#8217;t be worse than wine. Anyway,
they say, young as he is, that&#8217;s one of his
pleasures. He doesn&#8217;t look to me as if drinking
had ever bothered him much but, from what I
hear, he&#8217;s come to the point where his father
thinks he&#8217;s got to stop it if it&#8217;s ever going to be
stopped. He&#8217;s only been in town a few days
and they say he rides like a States&#8217; Indian.
But this hasn&#8217;t taken all his time. He&#8217;s already
in with the fast set here and you know, in a
pinch there&#8217;s people in Calgary who can give
a pretty good imitation of high life in great
cities.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can guess the rest,&#8221; said Norman. &#8220;His
father brought him out here to put him on a
ranch. When he found that his son hadn&#8217;t this
idea, it rather upset certain plans.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;d like us to put in a few knocks but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
I reckon that&#8217;ll be some job. As far as I can
see, it&#8217;s young fellows like Zept who turn these
hardships into glories. I&#8217;ve heard of kids like
him who are really at home where there&#8217;s no
trail and whose idea of luxury is a canoe and
a blanket and a piece of pork.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; concluded Norman, &#8220;if I didn&#8217;t
have the aeroplane bug just now, I&#8217;d like to
have a chance at the ponies and horses on one
of Mr. Zept&#8217;s big ranches. A canoe and a
blanket are all right, but on a cold evening when
the snow&#8217;s spitting I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ve got
anything on a chuck wagon and a good tent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>On the way to the show grounds, Roy went
into further details of the gossip he had heard
concerning young Zept&#8217;s escapades, not only in
Paris but in the south of France.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing&#8217;s sure,&#8221; commented Norman at
last, &#8220;wild as he may be about a lot of things,
he ain&#8217;t crazy about airships. That&#8217;s saying
something these days.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This remark was made because the Count,
while showing a polite interest in the <i>Gitchie
Manitou</i>, had not bubbled over with exuberance.
The boys felt somewhat chagrined over this
lack of enthusiasm until they recalled that to
young Zept an airship was an old story, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
young man having witnessed many flights by
the most improved French monoplanes.
</p>
<p>On this, the second day of the Stampede,
about five o&#8217;clock Norman made a respectable
if not very exciting flight. He was somewhat
nervous and was glad when the exhibition was
over, and had no sooner landed than he determined
on the following day to attempt a more
ambitious demonstration. On Wednesday and
Thursday he added some thrills to his evening
flight, making on the latter evening a landing
in the shape of a corkscrew spiral that got for
him special notice in the newspapers the next
morning. It also got for him an admonition
from his father, when the latter read this
story, that a repetition of it would result in a
breaking of his contract with the Stampede
authorities.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, father,&#8221; conceded the young
aviator, &#8220;but that ain&#8217;t a marker to the possibilities
of the machine. I haven&#8217;t put over the
real stunt yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;s that?&#8221; demanded his parent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had planned, on the last day of the show,
to make an ascent as high as one reservoir of
gas would take me&mdash;and that means so high
that you couldn&#8217;t see me&mdash;and then make a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
volplane back to the ground without using the
engine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to try that?&#8221; demanded his
father sternly.
</p>
<p>The boy looked at him and laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably not&mdash;now,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;although
the show&#8217;d be over then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Try it,&#8221; snapped his father, &#8220;and that&#8217;ll
be the last thing you&#8217;ll have to do with your
<i>Gitchie whatever-you-call-it</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The next evening, which concluded the big
day of the Stampede, twenty thousand people
attended the long afternoon&#8217;s program. When
the aeroplane appeared for its fourth flight, an
army of people surrounded the starting field.
Warned by his father, Norman made a less
dangerous exhibit, but one that was on the whole
more interesting to the eager spectators. Having
given illustrations of many of the tricks of
show aviators, including the roll and the banking
of racing machines on short circular courses,
he made a journey out over the hills until the
aeroplane was lost to sight. The enthusiasm
that greeted his reappearance and the approach
of the machine like a bird through the blue haze
of the endless prairies, stirred the crowd as the
more dangerous maneuvers had not. Before
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
reaching the inclosure, the monoplane climbed
about four thousand feet into the air and then
volplaned gracefully toward one of the large
exhibition buildings just in the edge of the
grounds. When it seemed as if Norman was
about to smash the <i>Gitchie Manitou</i> against
the big green-roofed building, even Roy started
and held his breath. Then there was a quick
spring upwards and, with the last momentum
of the gliding monoplane, it lifted over the
structure and settled upon the dust of the race
track inclosure like a wide-winged bird.
</p>
<p>When, escorted by ample police, the aeroplane
had been wheeled into the aerodrome,
the two boys immediately closed the doors and
the officers dispersed the onlookers. It was
late and there was not much trouble in doing
this. When only a few persons were left in
the vicinity, the doors were thrown open again
and the car was trundled out to receive its after-flight
examination. Norman, yet wearing his
cap and jacket, had climbed into the cockpit
to overhaul the rudder wires and engine valves;
Roy was inspecting the body of the car, when
the attention of both boys was attracted by a
cheery salutation from a stranger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good evening, young gentlemen,&#8221; exclaimed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
a man who was unmistakably from the States.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to have a look at your machine
but I&#8217;ve only just now succeeded in
evading the police. I hope I&#8217;m not in the
way?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Since there were few persons about, the
boys smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to see you,&#8221; answered Roy. &#8220;Glad
to see anyone if he comes alone. It&#8217;s only the
mob that bothers us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The stranger smiled and lifted his hat in
renewed greeting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been watching your flight to-day,&#8221; he
went on, directing his remark to Norman, &#8220;and
I judge it must require some nerve.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It requires a good machine and some little
experience,&#8221; responded Norman deprecatingly.
</p>
<p>The man was a well-set-up, ruddy complexioned
individual somewhat beyond middle age.
His clothes might have been made anywhere in
the East and yet, in spite of certain smart
touches in them, the man wore a negligee shirt,
a flowing black necktie and an abundance of
hair that indicated an acquaintance with the
freer costumes and manners of the West. A
large diamond ring on his weatherworn and
sinewy finger suggested that this jewelry was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
probably only worn on occasions. He had a
good-natured countenance which unquestionably
could easily show decision and force of
character.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; remarked Roy, good-humoredly.
&#8220;Sorry I can&#8217;t offer you a chair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Seriously,&#8221; retorted the stranger, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been watching you with more than mere curiosity.
I have a special desire to know something
about your airship if you can give me a few
minutes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Without questioning the man further, the
two boys, glad enough of the opportunity, at
once began an explanation of the craft that had
in the last few days demonstrated its practicability.
The stranger followed them intently,
interrupting them now and then with questions,
and showed a surprising interest in the elaborate
description given him by the young aviators.
Considering its origin, the aeroplane was a
more than ingenious piece of work. In general
it followed the stream lines of the modern
French monoplane. Its distinguishing variation
was a somewhat wider bulge in the forward
part of its birdlike body.
</p>
<p>While in most monoplanes this framework,
to which the planes are attached, is made only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
wide enough to accommodate a narrow cockpit
and the compact engine located in its apex, in
this car the cockpit was almost double in size
that of the average machine. So wide was it
that two passengers might sit side by side. The
flying planes of the car and its five-foot body
gave the aeroplane an entire width of thirty-seven
feet.
</p>
<p>The planes were attached to the body proper
by rigid flanges, reinforced by wires running
from tip to tip of the planes, passing directly
over the body, and not elevated on bracing
chandelles. These wires were taut and made
a part of the planes, much like reinforcing ribs.
Beneath the planes three heavy wires ran from
their forward tips to the bottom of the car.
</p>
<p>There were no flexing devices to manipulate
the rear edges of the planes, but on the rigid
frames of each plane was a lateral rudder
manipulated by one lever standing in the forward
part of the cockpit.
</p>
<p>The stream lines of the body tapered birdlike
to the horizontal rudder twenty feet in the rear.
The truss work of the body was covered with
diagonally crossing strips of veneer, so that,
as a whole, with the rigid planes, the monoplane
had a substantial appearance. This
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
frame, covered with waterproof canvas, made
the body of the car impervious to rain.
</p>
<p>The two rudders at the rear of the body
resembled in all ways the steering devices of
the best modern air vehicles. A difference was
found at once, however, in the fact that the
rudders were heavily waterproofed and in that
the steering wires passed the pilot&#8217;s cockpit
through the protected body of the car. There
was nothing new in either the big single propeller
fixed to the front of the body, nor in the
Gnome engine that afforded motive power.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t make the engine,&#8221; explained
Norman. &#8220;It represents all the money Moulton
and I have ever saved, some we haven&#8217;t
saved but expect to save, and all that we could
borrow of our fathers. It&#8217;s eighty horse power,
came all the way from France, and if anything
happens to it, we&#8217;re bankrupt for life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The stranger smiled with a curious sparkle
in his eyes, rubbed his chin, and without direct
answer, remarked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem an ordinary machine&mdash;looks
more substantial than most of &#8217;em.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Roy had secured a box, and placing it alongside
the car he motioned their guest to mount.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a difference,&#8221; he began at once
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
with new enthusiasm. &#8220;This machine is made
for wind and weather. If any airship can make
its way through blizzards, the <i>Gitchie Manitou</i>
can. If it doesn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s a rank failure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The guest gave a look at each boy, as if this
was what he suspected.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; went on Roy. Springing into the
cockpit, the two boys caught the sides of the
cockpit framework and in a moment had drawn
above their heads four light but strong frames
of wood. When these met above their heads,
they formed a curved and tightly-jointed canopy.
The four frames were filled with small
panes of glasslike mica. Within the canopy the
inmates were as well protected from the elements
as if they had been under a roof.
</p>
<p>While the stranger&#8217;s face flushed and his
eyes grew wider, the boys unsnapped the frames
and they fell back into place, disappearing
within the sides of the cockpit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t all,&#8221; exclaimed Norman, and he
pointed to two small, dark, metal boxes just in
the rear of the two seats. &#8220;Look,&#8221; he went
on, as he also pointed to a small dynamo
mounted just in the rear of the circular engine.
&#8220;As long as the car&#8217;s moving, these two little
car heaters will not only keep us from getting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
frost bites but, in a pinch, we can cook on &#8217;em.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And here,&#8221; added Roy, as he tapped a
chestlike object on which the seats were
mounted, &#8220;is where we get the stuff to do the
trick. We can put gas enough in there to
carry us three hundred miles. Back here,&#8221; he
went on, pointing to a nest of skeleton shelves
adjoining the rear of the cockpit, &#8220;we can
carry extra supplies of oil, gas, and food to
carry us five hundred miles, if we ever get that
far from home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In what was little less than complete enthusiasm,
the curious guest sprang speechless from
the box, and took a few quick steps as if to
arrange his thoughts.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s all,&#8221; exclaimed the
hardly less enthusiastic Norman as he vaulted
from the novel pilot-cage. &#8220;I guess you see
what we&#8217;re driving at and why we called our
machine <i>Gitchie Manitou</i>. You know that&#8217;s
Cree for&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; broke in the stranger; &#8220;Injun
for &#8216;Storm God&#8217;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it was &#8216;God of the Winds,&#8217;&#8221; exclaimed
Roy. &#8220;But names don&#8217;t count. If
they did, we should have called it &#8216;The Snow
King,&#8217; because that&#8217;s where it ought to shine.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
See these landing wheels?&#8221; he urged. &#8220;Well,
they&#8217;re only put on for use around here. If
this machine ever gets where it belongs it&#8217;s
going to have runners like a sled, where these
wheels are. And I&#8217;ve got a theory that these
are all it needs to make a trip where dogs and
sleds can&#8217;t travel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The two boys, eager to continue their half-told
description, paused for a moment. The
stranger, his hat in his hand, seemed to be
drinking in the story he had just heard, with
an interest so profound that the puzzled boys
could not grasp it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Young men,&#8221; said the man at last, &#8220;I&#8217;m
mighty glad to hear all this. I wish you&#8217;d let
me do some talking myself for a few moments.
Will you let me tell you something about myself?
It won&#8217;t take long. I hope,&#8221; and he
motioned the two boys to the seats on the box,
&#8220;when I&#8217;m through, it will interest you.&#8221; That
it did, the next chapter will amply prove.

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>COLONEL HOWELL MAKES A NOVEL PROPOSAL</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;My name is Howell,&#8221; began the man; &#8220;Hill
Howell,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;and in the places where
I&#8217;m best known I&#8217;m frequently called &#8216;Colonel&#8217;
Howell, but I don&#8217;t get that title because I am
a native Kentuckian. I secured it up in this
part of the world&mdash;just why, I don&#8217;t know.
I&#8217;m not going to tell you the story of my life
or of any remarkable adventures, because I&#8217;m
only a plain business man. But I&#8217;ll have to
repeat to you some account of my experience in
the Northwest before you understand why I&#8217;m
so interested in your machine and in you young
men.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In Kentucky,&#8221; resumed Colonel Howell,
after he had helped himself to a cigar from his
vest pocket, &#8220;we once thought we had oil. To
prove how little we had, I spent my own small
means and, while I got no oil to speak of, I got
a considerable knowledge of this industry. This
came just in time for me to make my way to
Kansas. That was fifteen years ago. There
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
I found not only oil but considerable return for
my labors. It didn&#8217;t make me a rich man, but
it gave me all the money I needed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I discovered that I had considerable
of the spirit of adventure in me and I started
for the Klondike. Like many another mistaken
prospector, I determined to go overland and
down the Mackenzie River. With a small party
I started down the Athabasca River from Athabasca
Landing. I would probably have gone on
and died in the wilderness, as most adventurers
did who took this route, but when we had
gone three hundred miles down the river and
were just below the Big Rapids, at a place they
call Fort McMurray, I caught the odor of oil
again and the Klondike fever disappeared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I saw the tar sands and the plain
signs of oil in the Fort McMurray region, I separated
from the party and stopped in the new
oil region. There were a few prospectors in
the vicinity and having got the oil mania again,
I found I was not prepared to make more than
a preliminary prospect. My former companions
had consented to leave me but few provisions.
I had to live practically alone and
without adequate provisions or turn back
towards civilization at once.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;To the others in the field I discredited the
possibilities of the region and set out on foot,
with a single Indian as a guide, to make my
way to Athabasca Landing. Here I planned
to secure food and proper tools and machinery
to return to Fort McMurray and develop what
I believed would be a sensational sub-arctic
oil region.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard about it,&#8221; broke in Norman.
&#8220;You pass Lac la Biche going there, don&#8217;t
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colonel Howell nodded and proceeded: &#8220;It
was impossible to return to Athabasca Landing
by canoe, as the river is too swift. For that
reason I made a thirty-day trip on foot and
reached the Landing with the winter well advanced.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here I found I could not get what machinery
I needed and I put off my project until the
next season when the ice had gone out of the
river. I returned to the States and in the following
July I went back to the Landing ready
to go down the river once more. I took with
me, from Chicago and Edmonton, well-boring
machinery and ample provisions for a year&#8217;s
stay in the wilderness. At Athabasca Landing
I found it impossible to buy proper boats and I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
lost considerable time in making two large flatboats
patterned after the Hudson&#8217;s Bay Company&#8217;s
batteaux.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Sturgeon heads,&#8217;&#8221; exclaimed Roy. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
always wanted to see one of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what they call &#8217;em,&#8221; exclaimed the
colonel. &#8220;I guess I don&#8217;t need to describe
them to you. Well, when they were completed,
I loaded my machinery, quite a batch of lumber,
and my flour and pork&mdash;I freighted all of this
one hundred miles from Edmonton&mdash;and with
three workmen, set out down the river with an
Indian crew and a couple of old-time steersmen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who were they?&#8221; broke in Roy, with apparently
uncalled-for eagerness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The best on the river,&#8221; answered the colonel.
&#8220;Old Moosetooth Martin and Bill La
Biche.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, they&#8217;re here on the ground!&#8221; almost
shouted Roy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; exclaimed Colonel Howell. &#8220;Do
you know them? I&#8217;m on my way back to the
Landing now. They&#8217;re going with me again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Roy&#8217;s mouth was open, as if this was a statement
not to be lightly passed over, but Norman
stopped him with an impatient: &#8220;Go on,
please.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you about them later,&#8221; the colonel
added, as if to appease Roy. &#8220;They&#8217;re both
fine old Indians and I&#8217;ve been with them a good
bit to-day. But even the best of them have
their faults. You know, at the Grand Rapids
these flatboats ought to be unloaded. Even
then the best steersman is bound to lose a boat
now and then on the rocks. Both Moosetooth
and La Biche cautioned me against running the
Rapids loaded, but as it would take a week to
portage around the Rapids, I took a chance.
Moosetooth got through all right, but La Biche&mdash;and
I reckon he&#8217;s the better man of the two&mdash;at
least I had him on the more valuable
boat&mdash;managed to find a rock and we were
in luck to reach the bank alive.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All my iron tubing and drilling machinery
disappeared in the Rapids. There was no way
to recover it and we went to Fort McMurray in
the other boat. It carried my lumber and most
of the provisions, but I couldn&#8217;t work without
tools. There was nothing to do but make the
best of it and I left my three men to build a
cabin and spend the winter in the wilderness
while I went back on foot again to the Landing
to buy a new outfit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, that was tough,&#8221; commented Norman.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You boys have lived in the Northwest long
enough to have learned the great lesson of this
country,&#8221; explained Colonel Howell. &#8220;This
is a region where you can&#8217;t have a program and
where, if you can&#8217;t do a thing to-day, you can
do it some other time. And, after all, it isn&#8217;t
a bad philosophy, just so long as you keep at it
and do it sometime. They seem to do things
slowly sometimes up in this wilderness land,
but they always seem to do them in the end.
I guess it&#8217;s the Indian way. I notice they always
drive ahead until they get there, although
there may be a good many stops on the way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what?&#8221; persisted Roy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to come back to the States&mdash;that was
the end of last season,&#8221; continued the man,
&#8220;and now I&#8217;m on my way again to reach the
Athabasca. My outfit is in Edmonton, I hope.
But this year I&#8217;ll have a little less trouble.
There&#8217;s a railroad now between Edmonton and
Athabasca Landing and I expect to get my
equipment and my stores to the river in freight
cars. I&#8217;ve been detained by other business and
should have been in Fort McMurray by this
time, as the ice goes out of the river late in
May. And I have my boats this year that
I bought before I left the Landing.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But when I tried to arrange for my old
steersmen to pilot me down the river again, I
found that energetic Calgary had beaten me to
it. Moosetooth and La Biche are not the best
boatmen on the Athabasca, but they are the
ones I want. And I&#8217;m here, waiting for the
show to close. They will go with me, and I
suppose their families as well,&#8221; added Colonel
Howell with a grimace, &#8220;directly to Athabasca
Landing, and in a week from now there is no
reason why we should not be drifting down the
big river again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then your trouble&#8217;ll begin again, won&#8217;t
it?&#8221; asked Norman.
</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Colonel Howell sat in
silence a few moments.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a good deal I might say about the
country I&#8217;m going into,&#8221; he continued at last,
&#8220;but I think you young men understand it
pretty well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty well up into the Barren Lands, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221; asked Roy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The last of the wilderness before you reach
the treeless plains,&#8221; explained the colonel, &#8220;but
as far as Fort McMurray the region is a vast
trail-less extent of poplar and spruce. The
winter comes in November and lasts until June.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
In that period, when the nights grow long, you
have a pretty good imitation of the Arctic.
There are Indians here and there and game
abounds, but the white man passes only now and
then. The dog and sled are yet the winter
means of transportation and here you may find
the last of the trappers that have made history
in the great Northwest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of this region will undoubtedly in
time provide farms, but as yet no farmer has
learned how to use the rich black soil of its river
lands in the short summer seasons. In time,
powerful steamers will navigate the Athabasca
and also, in time, there will be railroads. When
they come,&#8221; the speaker went on with a chuckle,
&#8220;I hope to be able to supply them with oil.
This at least is why, for the third time, I&#8217;m
making my way into that little-known country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you don&#8217;t get dumped again,&#8221; suggested
Norman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How genuinely do you hope that?&#8221; asked
Colonel Howell instantly and with renewed
animation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I just hope it,&#8221; answered Norman,
somewhat perplexed.
</p>
<p>Colonel Howell hesitated a moment and then
said abruptly: &#8220;You two boys are the best
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
guarantee I could have against another accident.
I want you to help me make a success of
this thing. I&#8217;ve an idea and I got it the moment
I saw your aeroplane to-day. Come with me
into the wilderness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Us?&#8221; exclaimed both boys together.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; hastily went on the oil man.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see what I&#8217;ve been driving at?
Don&#8217;t you recall the two long trails I made back
to civilization&mdash;a month each time? Think of
this: When I leave Athabasca Landing, the
only way by which I can communicate with the
world behind me is by courier, on foot; from
Fort McMurray this means a tramp of four
weeks for me, and even to a skilled Indian it
means three hundred miles through the poplar
forest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what could we do?&#8221; asked the breathless
Roy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If what you tell me about your airship is
true, you can make almost daily trips for mail.
At least, it would be as easy for me to keep in
touch with civilization as if I had a railroad
train at my disposal,&#8221; declared Colonel Howell
springing to his feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we couldn&#8217;t do that,&#8221; began Norman.
&#8220;Our fathers&mdash;&#8221;
</p>

</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of all the energy you have
expended on this machine?&#8221; demanded the man
earnestly. &#8220;Is it a dream or do you believe
what you have told me? I&#8217;m not a millionaire,
but I&#8217;m sure I could make your services to me
worth while. At least you don&#8217;t need to hesitate
on that score. I think you can do all you
have said this machine can do. Anyway, I&#8217;ll
pay you well for making the attempt, and I&#8217;ll
undertake to get the consent of your fathers.
Of course you can&#8217;t go without that. Would
you be willing to go if I can arrange this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet your life!&#8221; announced Roy instantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty serious thing,&#8221; began Norman,
&#8220;and dangerous too&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; broke in Colonel Howell, &#8220;then you&#8217;d
rather have some one else try out your glass
cage and electric stoves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s a long way from home,&#8221; went on
Norman, growing red in the face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No farther for you than for me,&#8221; explained
the colonel, still laughing. &#8220;And we&#8217;ll all go to
Fort McMurray on the flatboats. If you can&#8217;t
fly back you can at least do what I have done
twice&mdash;walk.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And Moosetooth and La Biche are going
to run the boats?&#8221; asked Norman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They certainly are,&#8221; answered Colonel
Howell, &#8220;and if you&#8217;re interested in those
things, there&#8217;ll be plenty of moose and bear and
deer standin&#8217; on the river banks waiting for a
shot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Norman looked at Roy, who was almost a
picture of disgust, and then, in self-defense, he
said: &#8220;I&#8217;d like to go if the folks consent. As
for that car, it&#8217;ll do everything we&#8217;ve said and
don&#8217;t you forget that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colonel Howell, apparently taking this as a
surrender, caught the two boys by their shoulders
and exclaimed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gettin&#8217; late. Lock up your shop and
let&#8217;s go and see what your fathers think of my
project.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elated and nervous, the boys turned and, as
if under a hypnotic spell, began to push the car
into the aerodrome. And once inside the little
building, with set lips, as if working his courage
up to that point, Norman broke the silence by
saying: &#8220;I was going to make my first trip to
the States this winter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Next summer would be a better time. Why
don&#8217;t you go in style?&#8221; asked Colonel Howell.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
&#8220;We&#8217;ll come out in the spring and we ought to
have a comfortable enough home during the
bad weather. You can&#8217;t spend your money and
when you get back home you can make your
trip and go all over the States.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Both boys looked at him as if not knowing
what to say next.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never hired any aviators,&#8221; went on Colonel
Howell, with his old smile coming back,
&#8220;and I don&#8217;t know the union price of aerial
operators, but I&#8217;ll give you your board and keep
and three hundred dollars a month apiece while
you&#8217;re with me. How does that strike you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll be worth it,&#8221; were the
only words that Roy could find to express his
dazed feelings.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t know anything about that,&#8221;
said Colonel Howell promptly. &#8220;You might
easily be worth a great deal more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>While the colonel spoke, he could not help
noticing Norman&#8217;s rapid calculation on the ends
of his fingers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In April, that would be nine months,&#8221; remarked
Norman at last, &#8220;and that&#8217;s twenty-seven
hundred dollars. We could go to France
on that, Roy,&#8221; he added suddenly. &#8220;Let&#8217;s lock
up and go home.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>In a few moments the excited aviators and
the well-satisfied Colonel Howell emerged from
the aerodrome just as young Count Zept ran
up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you fellows going to stay here all
night?&#8221; he exclaimed, almost out of breath.
&#8220;I thought you told me you&#8217;d meet me at seven
o&#8217;clock at the car. Father&#8217;s been there for a
half hour. We&#8217;re waiting to take you home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was necessary at once to introduce Colonel
Howell to young Zept. As the oil man heard
the name, his face brightened anew.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not the son of Jack Zept, are you?&#8221;
the colonel asked as he grasped the young man&#8217;s
hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;John C. Zept is my father&#8217;s name,&#8221; answered
the Count. &#8220;He&#8217;s a horse ranchman.
Do you know him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The colonel chuckled. &#8220;Of course,&#8221; he answered
hastily. &#8220;I met him on the upper
Peace; shot sheep with him in &#8217;95. Forgot he
lived here. If I can join you, I&#8217;d like to meet
your father. You can put me down at the King
George. I think,&#8221; the smiling colonel added,
turning to Norman and Roy, &#8220;that you boys
had better go home, talk it over with your
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
fathers, and I&#8217;ll look you up a little later in the
evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anywhere you like,&#8221; exclaimed the young
Count, &#8220;the machine&#8217;s waiting. Father&#8217;ll be
glad to see an old friend.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>COLONEL HOWELL DISCOVERS AN OLD FRIEND IN JACK ZEPT</h3>
</div>

<p>Although it was well after seven o&#8217;clock, it
was wholly light, for in Calgary in July dusk
does not come until after ten o&#8217;clock. While
Norman looked at his watch to confirm the
delay, Colonel Howell remarked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems good to get back to long hours
again. When we get up to Fort McMurray,&#8221;
and he chuckled, &#8220;you boys can read your newspapers,
if you can find any, out of doors after
eleven o&#8217;clock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fort McMurray?&#8221; broke in young Zept.
&#8220;Where&#8217;s that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Way up in the wilderness,&#8221; responded
Norman, laughing. &#8220;Looks as if we&#8217;re going
to beat you into the northland.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Instantly the young Count caught Norman by
the arm and stopped him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; he demanded,
his face a study in acute interest and
surprise.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Tell you later,&#8221; answered Norman. &#8220;Your
father&#8217;s waiting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Far from satisfied, the exuberant young Austrian
followed the others to Mr. Zept&#8217;s waiting
car. He was not in error as to his father&#8217;s
annoyance. The old ranchman, a heavy cigar
buried in the corner of his mouth, watched the
approach of the party with a scowl. The moment
he saw Colonel Howell, however, this expression
politely changed. The ranchman did
not at once recognize his old shooting friend but
without waiting for an introduction he sprang
with agility from his handsome motor.
</p>
<p>It required but a word, however, for him to
place the stranger and then the delay was forgotten.
The joviality of the veteran horse
raiser took the place of his petulance and, ignoring
the young men, the old friends stood arm in
arm for ten minutes recounting the past. The
result was inevitable. After Colonel Howell
had been catechised as to his present location
and plans, he could not refuse an invitation to
pass the remainder of his short stay in Calgary
at the Zept home.
</p>
<p>When the two men at last took the rear seat
in the car, Norman and Roy in front of them,
and Paul seated alongside the chauffeur, orders
were given to drive to the King George.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>Avoiding the traffic streets and trolley lines,
the big car was turned south through the suburban
hills. In the meantime, Paul had lost no
opportunity to probe into the mystery of Norman&#8217;s
remark. In return, Norman had rapidly
sketched an outline of Colonel Howell&#8217;s proposition
and of the present situation. Norman&#8217;s
rapid words seemed at first to have rather a
depressing effect on young Zept, and then, when
the whole idea had been put before him, his
usual animation rose to what was almost excitement.
</p>
<p>No sooner had the motor found its way into
the broad suburban streets, than Paul almost
sprang over the seat back and in a moment had
located himself between his father and Colonel
Howell on the rear seat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; he began impulsively, interrupting
some old-time talk, &#8220;do you know that Mr.
Grant and Mr. Moulton are going to Fort McMurray
with Colonel Howell?&#8221;
</p>
<p>These business details had not reached Mr.
Zept, as he and his guest had not yet exhausted
their old-time hunting experiences. The result
was that Colonel Howell at once related what
had taken place that afternoon, to all of which
Mr. Zept gave earnest attention. Colonel
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
Howell concluded by telling how he was to see
the fathers of the boys that evening in an effort
to consummate his deal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think about it?&#8221; asked Colonel
Howell with his usual smile, and looking
at Mr. Zept.
</p>
<p>The latter paused, as if in grave doubt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a hard question to answer,&#8221; he said
at last. &#8220;These young fellows ought to answer
it best themselves. Their airship has
given a pretty good account of itself. I did not
understand that it was more than the ordinary
flying machine, but if it is and they feel sure
that it can do what they say it will, it seems to
me that the whole thing is pretty much a business
proposition. You&#8217;ve made a fine proposition
to the young men, financially. If it wasn&#8217;t
for that, if you want me to speak frankly, I
wouldn&#8217;t approve their going into that part of
the world simply as prospectors.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;d be great!&#8221; broke in his son.
</p>
<p>&#8220;From your point of view, yes,&#8221; answered
his father, affectionately dropping his hand
upon Paul&#8217;s knee, &#8220;but you know, my boy, that
you have a lot of impractical ideas about this
corner of the world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to go too,&#8221; persisted the young man,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
who in his eagerness seemed to have given little
heed to his father&#8217;s words. &#8220;Can&#8217;t I go with
you?&#8221; he went on, turning to Colonel Howell.
</p>
<p>The latter looked somewhat perturbed. He
had no answer ready just then and he needed
none.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re taking men with you,&#8221; went on Paul
as he slid to the edge of the seat. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go and
work for you for nothing. You&#8217;ve got to have
men on the river and I know I&#8217;m as good as
any Indian, except Moosetooth of course.&#8221;
Everyone smiled except Mr. Zept. &#8220;And I
know there are a lot of things that I could do
in camp. I wouldn&#8217;t be any good about the airship,
I know, but I can shoot and I know I can
stand anything that anyone else can. I&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Young man,&#8221; broke in Mr. Zept at last,
&#8220;these gentlemen are going north on business.
Colonel Howell is not heading a pleasure excursion
and I doubt if he has any intention of
making an asylum for amateur woodsmen. Let
me tell you something: you&#8217;ve got to get on in
the world and you only do that, as far as I&#8217;ve
noticed, by having a purpose that has some reward
at the end of it. Colonel Howell and these
young men have a purpose and they&#8217;ll probably
profit by it. Playing Indian or wandering
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
around on the Barren Lands shooting moose
may be romantic enough and may be all you
want in life, but it doesn&#8217;t bring success as I
count it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father&#8217;s right, young man,&#8221; suggested
Colonel Howell; &#8220;success in life to-day is measured
by money. If you want to succeed that
way, stay where the money is to be found. I
can prove it,&#8221; he said, forcing a laugh. &#8220;Look
at me. What little money I have, I&#8217;m dumping
into the northern rivers. Then look at your
father. He knew the same wilderness you&#8217;re
trying to break into, but he only goes there for
pleasure. He had an idea and he came here and
put it over. I don&#8217;t know what it brought him,
and maybe you don&#8217;t. But I reckon you can
easily find out by going through a list of bank
directors in this town.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a millionaire anyway,&#8221; Roy exclaimed
with some lack of diplomacy.
</p>
<p>Mr. Zept did not seem conscious of this remark,
for he sat very stern and hard of face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When the time comes, my boy, I will take
you into this region that you are so full of. Just
now, I have other plans for you. We&#8217;ll talk
these over later.&#8221; Then, as if dismissing the
entire matter, Mr. Zept began to point out to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
Colonel Howell the improvements of the city
while the big machine sped toward the hotel.
</p>
<p>Paul, with a sullen look on his face, settled
back among the cushions, and Norman and Roy,
awed by the decisive tones of the rich man,
made no attempt at conversation.
</p>
<p>Reaching the hotel, Colonel Howell alighted
to prepare his luggage and see to telegrams and
mail. Mr. Zept stopped with him while Paul
took the young aviators to their homes. A
short time later the motor picked up Mr. Zept
and his guest and carried them to the Zept
home.
</p>
<p>Despite his general knowledge of his old
friend&#8217;s wealth, Colonel Howell was surprised
at the sight of his host&#8217;s home. This, less than
a half a dozen squares from the hotel, occupied
a city block and was a mansion resembling a
French chateau, built of the yellow stone of
the country. In addition to an attractive fence
of stone and iron, the extensive yard was surrounded
on all sides by a wind-break hedge of
tall and uniform swamp cedars.
</p>
<p>When the car dashed up the asphalt drive,
Colonel Howell only turned toward his host
and smiled. But while his elders alighted,
under the porte cochere, Paul did not smile.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
Waiting for his father and their guest to disappear
into the magnificent home, he sprang
into the motor again and said to the chauffeur:
&#8220;Drive to the King George Hotel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At dinner that evening there was a message
from young Paul, excusing himself on the
ground of an engagement. When Mr. Zept
heard this, he excused himself to telephone to
the garage. When he rejoined his guest, his
face was again stern and hard, for he knew
what his son&#8217;s engagement meant.
</p>
<p>Dinner over, the ranchman and Colonel Howell
made their excuses to Mrs. Zept and to
Paul&#8217;s young sister and retired to the library.
Here Mr. Zept used no ceremony and at once
confided to his old friend the greatest trouble of
his life. He told how he had brought his son
home from Paris because of his wayward ways
and how he had found these even more pronounced
than he feared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t a bad boy,&#8221; explained his father,
&#8220;and the only trouble he has I think I can correct
by home influence.&#8221; He even explained
where his son was at that moment and did not
attempt to conceal his mortification. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t
in the blood,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;but it&#8217;s Paris and
the opportunity he had there.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>Colonel Howell had been deeply moved by his
friend&#8217;s talk, and when the latter used the word
&#8220;opportunity,&#8221; his sober face suddenly lit up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;you&#8217;ve hit it.
I think I can read the boy like a book. &#8216;Opportunity&#8217;
to go wrong is what did it. I&#8217;ve an
idea. Cut out this &#8216;opportunity&#8217; and I think
you&#8217;ve solved the question.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I want to do,&#8221; replied Mr.
Zept, with a sigh, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve been trying to
make his home take the place of the saloons,
but,&#8221; and he shook his head, &#8220;you see where
he is now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; exclaimed Colonel Howell.
&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t need to discourage you. I
think we&#8217;ll have to send him where there isn&#8217;t
any Paris and where there aren&#8217;t any cafes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; broke in the disturbed
father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean up to Fort McMurray, where they&#8217;ll
put a man in jail if they find a drink of whisky
on his person.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Zept sat upright and darted a look at
his old friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; went on Colonel Howell.
&#8220;When you leave Athabasca Landing, the fellow
who tells you good-bye is a mounted policeman,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
and he doesn&#8217;t shake hands with you
either. If you&#8217;ve got a drop of whisky with
you, you&#8217;ve got to have it inside of you. If you
try to take whisky into that country, you&#8217;ve
got to be smarter than the smartest policemen
in the world. The &#8216;opportunity&#8217; is gone. And
there&#8217;s another thing,&#8221; went on the aroused
colonel. &#8220;If your boy thinks he&#8217;s been robbed
of something, when he finds he hasn&#8217;t anything
to drink, you can see yourself that he&#8217;ll have
plenty of other things to interest him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The agitated ranchman sprang to his feet and
took a quick turn around the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Howell!&#8221; he exclaimed at last, as he returned
and placed a hand on his friend&#8217;s
shoulder, &#8220;this upsets every plan I have.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe they ought to be upset,&#8221; rejoined
the oil man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; answered his friend thickly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s all pretty sudden and it&#8217;s all a kind of
a blow to me, but you&#8217;re right. What can I
do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy enough,&#8221; responded the other as he
relit his cigar; &#8220;he wants to go with me. Let
him have his way. I&#8217;ve never been called upon
to attempt anything in the reform line and I
don&#8217;t think I will be now. Let your son join
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
us and I think that&#8217;ll be the end of what is
causing you a good deal of misery. It isn&#8217;t
a case of curing him of the whisky habit. I
believe he&#8217;ll simply forget it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you take him?&#8221; suddenly asked Mr.
Zept, his face a little white.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; exclaimed Colonel Howell. &#8220;Call
it settled and get this terrible fear off your
mind. Paul&#8217;s all right and I&#8217;ll bet when you
see him again he&#8217;ll give an account of himself
that&#8217;ll make you proud.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the boy&#8217;s father was not so easily assured.
&#8220;Howell,&#8221; he said in a nervous tone,
&#8220;you&#8217;ve done something for me this evening
that I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever forget. I don&#8217;t
often talk about money, but I&#8217;m a rich man.
From what you&#8217;ve told me, I can see you&#8217;re yet
working pretty hard. You may have plenty of
money but no matter as to that. I know it
takes a lot of money to do what you&#8217;re doing.
I&#8217;m not doing this to show my appreciation of
what you&#8217;re willing to do for me, but it looks
as if you&#8217;re the only real friend I have in the
world. Let me put some money into this venture
with you&mdash;I don&#8217;t care how much&mdash;but
I&#8217;ve an interest in your project now&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Kentuckian was on his feet in a moment.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
&#8220;Jack,&#8221; he began without any show of resentment,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got all the money I&#8217;ll ever need
in this world. It&#8217;s fine of you to say what you
have, but now I&#8217;m going to make you a new
proposition. I&#8217;m willing to take your boy and
treat him as my own son but I&#8217;ll have to put
one condition on it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The ranchman only looked his surprise. A
wave of his hand indicated that any condition
would be met.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want him to go with me but I&#8217;ll only take
him as my guest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hill,&#8221; said Mr. Zept, after looking his
friend directly in the eye, &#8220;I knew from the
moment we first made camp together up on the
Peace, that you were the real stuff. I haven&#8217;t
any way to thank you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s compromise on another of those
cigars,&#8221; laughed Colonel Howell, &#8220;and then,
if it is agreeable to you, and I can have the use
of your car for a short time, I have some business
of my own.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After a few moments with his hostess, Colonel
Howell departed in the motor. As soon as he
was out of his host&#8217;s hearing, he ordered the
driver to take him to the King George Hotel.
Still puffing his new cigar, the oil man entered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
the hotel and made a quick examination of the
bar room. The person he was looking for was
apparently not in sight. Nodding his head to
an occasional acquaintance, Colonel Howell
made his way downstairs to the fashionable
cafe.
</p>
<p>He did not obtrude himself, but called the
head waiter and after a question, took out his
card and scribbled a line on it. A few moments
later, in the lobby of the hotel, he was joined by
young Count Zept, who explained that he had
been dining with a few friends. Colonel Howell
motioned him to a seat and gave no sign of
noticing the boy&#8217;s flushed face and somewhat
thick speech.
</p>
<p>He had spoken hardly a dozen words to the
excited young man, when the latter seemed to
throw off his condition as if it had been a cloak.
He even discarded the cigarette he was smoking.
Then the colonel resumed his talk with
the young man and for several minutes spoke
very earnestly in low tones.
</p>
<p>As he concluded, the young man sat sober
and tense.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel Howell,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it. I
understand everything. You have given me the
greatest chance of my life.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; came the cheery and quick rejoinder
of the Kentuckian, relighting his cigar,
as he appeared to be always doing under any
stress, &#8220;we&#8217;ll begin right away. This is a
business proposition and we&#8217;re all business
people. We haven&#8217;t any time to lose. I want
you to go home and begin to pack your kit. The
machine is outside. I think your father would
like to talk to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready now,&#8221; came the quick response.
A moment later the Zept motor was on its way
home.

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>NEGOTIATING AND OUTFITTING</h3>
</div>

<p>It had been an eventful day for the millionaire
ranchman and his son Paul, as well as for Norman
Grant and Roy Moulton, to whom it had
opened up possibilities that they could scarcely
yet realize. It was now Colonel Howell&#8217;s mission
further to enact the role of a magician and
to see if the plans he had outlined were to bear
fruit for the young aviators.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be waiting to hear,&#8221; announced the
young Count, as he alighted and gave the chauffeur
directions for finding the Grant and Moulton
homes, &#8220;and I want to know the news
to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be disappointed if it isn&#8217;t good news,&#8221;
responded the Kentuckian, &#8220;but don&#8217;t you worry
about that. We&#8217;re going anyway. You see
your father right away and he&#8217;ll begin to plan
your outfit. We&#8217;re going to leave, the airship
with us I hope, at three o&#8217;clock Monday afternoon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was half past nine when the oil prospector
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
reached the Grant home. The evening there
had been one resembling preparations for a
funeral. Colonel Howell&#8217;s offer had fallen on
the Grant family with no sign of joy in anyone
except the son. Dazed by the dangers which, to
Norman&#8217;s family, overshadowed all possible advantages,
small time was lost in calling Mr. and
Mrs. Moulton into the conference. After the
arrival of the latter, it had been a debate between
the two boys, their parents, and several
sisters, with no apparent possibility of reaching
a decision.
</p>
<p>Even the appearance of Colonel Howell did
not seem to help matters very much, but the
formalities having worn off and the prospector
having been invited to give his version of his
own plans, the possibilities began to brighten
for the young men. In the process of argument,
even the somewhat hesitating Norman had
talked himself into a wild eagerness to be allowed
to go.
</p>
<p>Roy was so impatient that he stuttered. The
different effect of Colonel Howell&#8217;s explanation
was undoubtedly due to the fact that he emphasized
the great possibilities of the business
part of the trip. Roy had sought to win favor
by expatiating on the ease with which the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
<i>Gitchie Manitou</i> was to overcome the perils and
privations of the almost Arctic region.
</p>
<p>Norman had also grown hoarse in demonstrating
the entire safety of their aircraft. But
their patron seemed to dismiss these arguments
as matters needing no discussion. Rather, he
drew a picture of the opportunities to be presented
to the boys in seeing the new land, of
what he called the comforts of their snug cabin
and of the advantages that must come to all
young men in becoming acquainted with the
little-known frontiers of their country. He
said little of the immediate pecuniary reward,
but said enough to have both fathers understand
just what this was to be.
</p>
<p>Both Mr. Grant and Mr. Moulton had had
their share of roughing it on the frontier and
neither seemed to welcome the sending of their
children against the privations that they had
endured.
</p>
<p>While the discussion dwindled into indecision,
Colonel Howell, as if in afterthought, repeated
in substance his talk with Mr. Zept,
omitting of course some of the unfortunate details,
all of which, however, were already well
known to those present.
</p>
<p>Mr. Zept was the leading citizen of Calgary,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
an influential and important man. He was also
a character whom most men in that part of the
country were proud to count as a friend.
Among those of her own sex, Mrs. Zept occupied
about the same position. When the flurry of
questions concerning Mr. Zept&#8217;s determination
to send his son as a member of the party had
died somewhat, it was perfectly plain that both
Mrs. Grant and Mrs. Moulton had new thoughts
on the proposition.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he going as a workman?&#8221; asked Roy
impulsively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;ll do all he&#8217;s called upon to do,&#8221;
answered Colonel Howell, taking advantage of
his opening, &#8220;but I really didn&#8217;t need any more
help. He&#8217;s going because his father thought
it would prove an advantage to him. In fact,&#8221;
continued the colonel, &#8220;Mr. Zept was kind
enough to want to contribute to our expenses
because his son was to be with us. But as I
told my old friend, I was not running an excursion,
and I have invited the young man to go
as my guest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;s paying us nearly three thousand
dollars to do what the Count was willing to pay
for,&#8221; exclaimed Norman, as a clincher. &#8220;What
have you got to say to that?&#8221; he added almost
defiantly, addressing his mother.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But he won&#8217;t have to go up in a flying
machine,&#8221; meekly argued Mrs. Grant.
</p>
<p>Norman only shrugged his shoulders in disgust.
&#8220;There won&#8217;t be any more danger in
that,&#8221; he expostulated, &#8220;than I&#8217;ve been in all
week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colonel Howell turned to Mr. Grant, who held
up his hands in surrender. Then he looked at
Mr. Moulton. The latter shook his head, but
the debate seemed to be closed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess they&#8217;re able to take care of themselves,&#8221;
conceded Mr. Grant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I started out younger,&#8221; added Mr. Moulton.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m planning to leave at three o&#8217;clock Monday
afternoon,&#8221; announced the Kentuckian,
with his most genial smile, &#8220;and we&#8217;ll have a
car ready for the machine Monday morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The conference immediately turned into a
business session to discuss immediate plans and
the outfit needed by the newly enlisted assistants.
In this the mothers took a leading part,
seeming to forget every foreboding, and when
Colonel Howell left, the two families were apparently
as elated as they had been despondent
on his arrival.
</p>
<p>The next day&#8217;s performance at the Stampede
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
was more or less perfunctory, so far as the
young aviators were concerned, and was only
different from the others in that Roy accompanied
Norman in the exhibition flight.
</p>
<p>Colonel Howell, after a day of activity in the
city, was present when the flight was made. No
time had been lost by the boys in arranging for
their departure, and mechanics in Mr. Grant&#8217;s
railroad department had been pressed into service
in the construction of three crates&mdash;a long
skeleton box for the truss body of the car, another,
wider and almost as long, to carry the dismounted
planes, and a solidly braced box for the
engine. The propeller and the rudders were
to go in the plane crate. These were promised
Sunday morning, and Norman and Roy took a
part of Saturday for the selection of their personal
outfits. Over this there was little delay,
as the practical young men had no tenderfoot
illusions to dissipate.
</p>
<p>The kind of a trip they were about to make
would, to most young men, have called for a
considerable expenditure. But to the young
aviators, life in the cabin or the woods was not
a wholly new story. Overnight they had talked
of an expensive camera, but when they found
that young Zept was provided with a machine
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
with a fine lens, they put aside this expenditure,
and the most expensive item of their purchases
was a couple of revolvers&mdash;automatics.
</p>
<p>Norman already owned a .303 gauge big game
rifle, but it was heavy and ammunition for it
added greatly to the weight to be carried in the
airship. With the complete approval of Colonel
Howell, he bought a new .22 long improved
rifle, which he figured was all they needed in
addition to their revolvers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great mistake,&#8221; explained Colonel
Howell, who had met the two boys at the outfitting
store just before noon, &#8220;for travelers to
carry these big game high-powered rifles. The
gun is always knocked down, is never handy
when you want it, and the slightest neglect puts
it out of commission. You take this little high-powered
.22, put it in a bag, throw a few cartridges
in your pocket, and you&#8217;ll get small
game and birds while you&#8217;re tryin&#8217; to remember
where the big gun is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; answered Roy. &#8220;Grant
and I were up in the mountains a year ago, back
of Laggan. We weren&#8217;t hunting especially, but
I was carryin&#8217; the old .303. Up there in the
mountains we walked right up on as fine an old
gold-headed eagle as you ever saw. I was going
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
to shoot, when I recollected that this wasn&#8217;t a
deer four hundred yards away. If I&#8217;d shot,
I&#8217;d have torn a hole through that bird as big as
your hat. If I&#8217;d had this,&#8221; and he patted the
smart looking little .22, &#8220;somebody would have
had a fine golden-headed eagle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colonel Howell had few suggestions to make,
but while he was in the store, he selected a small
leather-cased hatchet and an aluminum wash-pan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t laugh,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Just take
the word of an old campaigner and keep these
two things where you can put your hands on
&#8217;em. You can get along in the wilderness without
shootin&#8217; irons&mdash;or I can&mdash;but you&#8217;ll find
this tin pan a mighty handy friend. If your
wise friends laugh at your luxury just wait,
they&#8217;ll be the first ones to borrow it. You can
cook in it, wash in it, drink out of it, and I&#8217;ve
panned for gold with &#8217;em. It&#8217;s the traveler&#8217;s
best friend.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The outfitter was busy enough displaying his
wares, of which he had a hundred things that he
urged were indispensable, but he was not dealing
with States tenderfeet, and the volume of
his sales was small. In it, however, the boys
finally included two heavy Mackinaw jackets,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
two still heavier canvas coats reinforced with
lambs&#8217; wool, two cloth caps that could be pulled
down over the face, leaving apertures for the
eyes, and two pairs of fur gauntlets, mitten-shaped,
but with separate fore-fingers for shooting.
</p>
<p>The boys made these purchases on their own
account, and then Colonel Howell asked permission
to make them a present. He selected and
gave each of the boys a heavy Hudson&#8217;s Bay
blanket, asking for the best four-point article.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll last as long as you live,&#8221; explained
the oil man, &#8220;and when you don&#8217;t need &#8217;em in
the woods for a house or tent or bed, or even as
a sail, you&#8217;ll find they&#8217;ll come in handy at home
on your couch or as rugs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Each boy had his own blankets at home, but at
sight of those their new friend gave them their
eyes snapped. Roy selected a deep cardinal
one and Grant took for his a vivid green, both
of which had the characteristic black bars.
</p>
<p>&#8220;These look like the real things,&#8221; exclaimed
Roy, with enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;An Indian will give you anything he owns
for one of &#8217;em,&#8221; chuckled the colonel. &#8220;The
tin pan is a luxury, but you&#8217;ve got to have these.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
If you learn the art of how to fold and sleep in
&#8217;em, you&#8217;ll be pretty well fixed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colonel Howell did not seem to be worrying
about his own outfit, and when he left the boys
his work for the day was probably financial.
</p>
<p>By the middle of Sunday afternoon, the
<i>Gitchie Manitou</i> had been safely stored in its
new crates, and then, with a small tool chest
and a hastily-made box crowded with extra
parts, had been loaded on a large motor truck
and forwarded to the railroad yards. The remainder
of the day was utilized by the young
aviators in compactly packing their personal
belongings, and in the evening the two young
men had dinner at the Zept home. The young
Count, whom they had not seen since the day
before when he accompanied Colonel Howell at
the closing exercises of the Stampede, was present
and nervously enthusiastic.
</p>
<p>After dinner the three boys went to Paul&#8217;s
room where Grant and Roy were astonished at
the elaborateness of their friend&#8217;s outfit. Paul
had not confined himself to those articles suggested
by his practical father but had brought
together an array of articles many of which
were ridiculously superfluous.
</p>
<p>He had worked so seriously in his selection,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
however, that it was not a laughing matter. So
his new friends hesitated to tell him that half
of his baggage was not necessary. Therefore
they said nothing until Paul, having proudly
exhibited his several costumes, his new leather
cases for carrying his camera, field glasses, revolvers,
and two guns, noticed the lack of approval
on their faces.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, with a smile, &#8220;out with it.
I couldn&#8217;t help getting them, but I know I don&#8217;t
need all this stuff. You fellows know. Throw
out what I don&#8217;t need. I bought a lot of it in
Paris, but don&#8217;t mind that. I&#8217;m not going to
take a thing that I can do without.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Greatly relieved, Norman and Roy fell to
work on the elaborate assortment and in a short
time had but little more left in the heap than
one man could carry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; asked Roy, as they reached
a soft leather roll about the size of a big pillow,
carefully strapped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my blankets,&#8221; explained Paul, opening
the flap and exhibiting two soft fleecy articles.
&#8220;They&#8217;re from London.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; exclaimed Norman positively, &#8220;you
give them to your sister for her picnics. Then
you go down to-morrow morning and get a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
four-point Hudson&#8217;s Bay blanket, fourteen feet
long, pay your twelve dollars for it, get a strap
to hang it on your back, and I reckon you&#8217;ll have
about all you need.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A little later, when Paul&#8217;s father and Colonel
Howell visited the room and Paul good-naturedly
explained what his friends had done,
Mr. Zept laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you all that,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;but I
guess it was like the advice of most fathers.
These young men know what they&#8217;re doing.
Hill,&#8221; he said, turning to his guest, &#8220;I guess
you haven&#8217;t made any mistake in signing up
these kids. There&#8217;s a lot they may have to
find out about the wilderness, but it looks to me
as if they weren&#8217;t going to have very much to
unlearn.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The next morning was a long one. The baggage
car secured by Colonel Howell for the
aeroplane crates was soon loaded. Then nothing
remained to be done except, as Colonel
Howell put it, &#8220;to line up my Injuns.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Moosetooth and La Biche were yet in camp
at the Stampede Grounds. The boys, including
Count Zept, accompanied Colonel Howell to the
Grounds about noon. Here the oil prospector
was able to change his program somewhat, and
much to his gratification.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>Colonel Howell knew that his old steersmen
were accompanied by quite a group of relatives
but he did not know the exact extent of the Martin
and La Biche families. They were all in
charge of a man from Athabasca Landing, who
was of course under contract to return the Indians
to that place. Colonel Howell had thought
it would be necessary to look after the immediate
relatives of Moosetooth and La Biche, but when
he found that the women and children belonging
to these men would just as soon return to
the North with their friends, he was able to
arrange that the two old river men might precede
the main party and accompany him alone.
</p>
<p>The Indian makes very little ceremony of his
farewells to the members of their families and
after Colonel Howell had talked a few moments
with them the dark-skinned boatmen announced
themselves ready. The matter of luncheon
seemed to worry neither Moosetooth nor La
Biche. Each man had an old flour bag, into
which he indiscriminately dumped a few bannock,
some indistinguishable articles of clothing,
and relighting their pipes, were ready to
start for Fort McMurray.
</p>
<p>It was the first ride either Indian had ever
had in an automobile, but the quick run back
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
to the city seemed to make no impression upon
them. Leaving the taciturn Crees in the baggage
car, well supplied with sandwiches, fruit,
and a half dozen bottles of ginger ale, the others
once more headed for the Zept home. In two
hours the expedition would be off.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>THE EXPEDITION STRIKES A SNAG IN EDMONTON</h3>
</div>

<p>At three o&#8217;clock the fast express pulled
out of the big depot at Calgary on its way to
Edmonton, then the northern limit of railroad
transportation on the American Continent. A
part of the train was the sealed baggage car
carrying the airship. In the day coach, with
their bags in their laps, and still stolid of face,
sat Moosetooth Martin and old La Biche. For
the moment their pipes reposed in their vest
pockets. Each was eating an orange. Far in
the rear of the train, Colonel Howell&#8217;s little
expedition was making itself comfortable in a
stateroom. Somewhat to the surprise of the
younger members of the party, Mr. Zept had
joined them.
</p>
<p>The corners of the stateroom and the near-by
vestibule of the car were crammed with the personal
belongings of those headed for Fort
McMurray.
</p>
<p>Even in the excitement of leaving and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
farewells to the members of their families and
friends, neither Norman nor Roy failed to notice
that the young Count&#8217;s face again bore the flush
that did not come from exertion. Mr. Zept&#8217;s
face also bore the look that the boys had come
to know, the expression that they could not fail
to connect with the indiscretions of his son.
</p>
<p>If Colonel Howell saw these things, nothing
about him indicated it. Having divested himself
of his coat, he put himself at once in charge
of the party, and was full of animation.
</p>
<p>Within a few moments young Zept left the
stateroom, without protest from his father, and
the two boys partly lost themselves in a close
view of the country through which they were
passing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Things are changing very fast in this
region,&#8221; explained Mr. Zept, motioning to the
irregular hill-dotted country, in which patches
of vegetation alternated with semi-arid wastes.
&#8220;See how irrigation is bringing the green into
this land. Ten years ago, for fifty miles north
of Calgary, we called this The Plains. It&#8217;s all
changing. It&#8217;s all going to be farms, before
long. You&#8217;ll be surprised, however,&#8221; he continued,
addressing the boys. &#8220;Long before
night we&#8217;ll run out of this onto the green prairies.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
Long before we get to Edmonton, we&#8217;ll be
in some of the best farming land in the world.
And it goes on and on, more or less,&#8221; he added
with a faint smile, &#8220;a good deal farther than
we know anything about&mdash;maybe as far as
Fort McMurray,&#8221; he concluded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t any reason why Fort McMurray
can&#8217;t be a Calgary some day,&#8221; replied Colonel
Howell; &#8220;that is, when the railroads start towards
Hudson&#8217;s Bay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to have some land too,&#8221; suggested
Mr. Zept. &#8220;If you just had a few good
prairies and some grass lying loose around
up there, that&#8217;d help.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know we haven&#8217;t?&#8221; answered
the colonel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Zept. &#8220;If you
have, just send me word. We might start a
few horse ranches up there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As the train sped on and all had adjusted
themselves to the limits of their little room,
after a time Mr. Zept spoke again: &#8220;I wish
I had the time to go up there with you,&#8221; he
began, &#8220;but of course, that&#8217;s impossible. I&#8217;m
going to see you away from Edmonton in good
shape. By the way,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been
wondering just how you&#8217;re going to find things
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
up there, after a year&#8217;s absence. You say you
left three men there. What are they doing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; answered Colonel Howell, &#8220;they&#8217;re
all on the pay roll. One of &#8217;em&#8217;s an Englishman
from Edmonton, and two of &#8217;em I brought
from the gas fields of Kansas. The Kansas
men have worked for me for several years.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Must have had a pretty easy job, with
nothing to do but punish your provisions all
winter,&#8221; suggested Mr. Zept.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it,&#8221; exclaimed his friend.
&#8220;They had plenty of work cut out for them. In
the first place they had to build a cabin, and
they had the tools to make a decent one&mdash;tar
paper for a roof too. I don&#8217;t care for bark
shacks. Then I&#8217;m taking a boiler and engine
up this time and we can probably use a lot of
firewood when we get to drilling. They can
put in a lot of time cutting dry cordwood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They doing any prospecting?&#8221; asked the
ranchman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They couldn&#8217;t do much except look for
signs,&#8221; answered Colonel Howell. &#8220;And, of
course, if they have any extra time, the Kansas
men have been in the business long enough to
know how to do that. They might save me a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
lot of work when I get up there, if they&#8217;re on
the job,&#8221; concluded Colonel Howell.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A good deal like grub-staking a man, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221; asked Mr. Zept.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; retorted the oil man with decision.
&#8220;They&#8217;re all on my pay roll and
they&#8217;re all working for me. There isn&#8217;t any
halves business in what they find, if they find
anything. It all belongs to yours truly&mdash;or
will, when I prove up on my claim.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are the names of the men?&#8221; asked
Roy with sudden curiosity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Edmonton man I don&#8217;t know very
well,&#8221; answered Colonel Howell. &#8220;He is a
kind of a long range Englishman and I think his
name is Chandler. The other men are Malcolm
Ewen and Donald Miller. Ewen and Miller are
good boys, and I know they&#8217;ll give me a square
deal, whether Chandler sticks or not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In spite of the general conversation, Norman
fancied that Mr. Zept&#8217;s annoyance did not grow
less, and it was not hard to conclude that this
was due to Paul&#8217;s absence. Finally both Norman
and Roy excused themselves to visit the
observation car. They really wanted to find
Paul. He was not in the rear car, which fact
the young men learned after describing their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
companion to the colored porter, who smiled
significantly when he announced that Paul had
left the car some time before.
</p>
<p>The young men then went through the train
and at last found the Count in jovial companionship
with Moosetooth and La Biche. It was
plain that both the Indians had been drinking,
but there was no liquor now in sight, and the
three were enjoying their pipes and their cigarettes.
The Count had discovered that the
Indians knew more French than English, and he
was in high conversation with them. The boy
himself was even more jovial when he greeted
Norman and Roy with hearty slaps on the back.
</p>
<p>For some moments the visitors attempted to
join in the conversation between the Indians
and Paul, but the conditions were such that the
young aviators soon lost interest and they invited
young Zept to return to the stateroom for
a game of cards.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now,&#8221; protested the Count, dropping
into a seat opposite the Indians again. &#8220;My
friends here are great Frenchmen. They have
been telling me about the Barren Lands. Besides,&#8221;
and he frowned a little, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know
the governor was coming. I don&#8217;t think I ought
to see him just now. He ain&#8217;t much for this
sort of thing.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of thing?&#8221; asked Norman somewhat
brusquely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; answered the Count. &#8220;I was
just telling the boys good-bye. I&#8217;ll be all right
in a little while, and then I&#8217;ll come back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t fooling anyone,&#8221; broke in the
quick-tongued Roy, &#8220;and I think Colonel
Howell wants to see you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Count Zept&#8217;s laugh ended and he at once arose
and followed the young men back to the stateroom.
His reappearance seemed to ease his
father&#8217;s mind, and when the three young men
and Colonel Howell began a game of auction
the incident seemed almost forgotten.
</p>
<p>At six o&#8217;clock, the superintendent of the dining
car came to announce to Colonel Howell that
his special table was ready, and the party went
in to dinner.
</p>
<p>When this elaborate meal was concluded, an
hour and a half later, the warm afternoon had
cooled and the train was well into the fertile
farm land that distinguishes the great agricultural
regions south of Edmonton. Somewhat
after ten o&#8217;clock, the long daylight not yet
at an end, the journey came to a close in the
city of Strathcona. They had reached the
Saskatchewan River. Loading their baggage
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
into two taxicabs, they made a quick trip across
the river to Edmonton and the King Edward
Hotel.
</p>
<p>It was with a feeling of happiness that Norman
and Roy found themselves on what is now
almost the frontier of civilization. Their joy
did not lie in the fact that hereabouts might be
found traces of the old life, but that they were
at last well on their way toward their great
adventure.
</p>
<p>Rooms were at once secured and Mr. Zept and
Paul immediately retired. Norman and Roy
lingered a while to learn from Colonel Howell
the next step.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The crates will come across the river early
to-morrow morning,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;and we&#8217;ll
catch the Tuesday train at eight thirty for
Athabasca Landing. We&#8217;ll be there to-morrow
evening. Turn in and get a good night&#8217;s sleep.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was no trouble for the boys to do this, and
at seven o&#8217;clock the next morning they were
waiting for their friend and patron in the office.
When he appeared he was in company with Mr.
Zept and Paul, having apparently just aroused
them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, boys,&#8221; he began, using his perpetual
smile, &#8220;we&#8217;ve struck a little snag. But remember
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
the philosophy of the country&mdash;what you
can&#8217;t do to-day, do when you can. It&#8217;s the
train!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; exclaimed Norman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; explained Colonel Howell, &#8220;you
know they&#8217;re just finishing the railroad and
I was told that the trains are running to Athabasca
Landing. They were running a passenger
train about twenty-five miles out, but beyond
that there hasn&#8217;t been anything but a
construction train. There&#8217;s a new Provincial
Railway Commission and it decided only the
other day that no more passengers could be
carried. The road hasn&#8217;t been turned over yet
by the contractor and they&#8217;re afraid to let anyone
ride on the construction train. We could
get as far as the passenger train goes and
there we&#8217;d be stalled. Looks like I&#8217;d have to do
some hustling.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can go in an automobile,&#8221; suggested
young Zept, who apparently had secured some
information about the country.
</p>
<p>But Colonel Howell shook his head. &#8220;There
are only two automobiles in that service and
they&#8217;re both stuck somewhere in the mud between
here and the Landing. Besides, that
wouldn&#8217;t do us much good. I find that my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
two carloads of oil machinery are yet in Edmonton
and then there&#8217;s the airship crates.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we carry it all by wagon?&#8221; asked
Norman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; responded the colonel. &#8220;It&#8217;d
make a caravan. We might get through in good
weather but the trail is impassable now. We&#8217;ve
got to go by train.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And can&#8217;t!&#8221; commented Roy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to-day,&#8221; laughed Colonel Howell, &#8220;but
the season&#8217;s young yet. There&#8217;ll be another
train starting out day after to-morrow. We&#8217;ll
have to turn up something. Meanwhile, let&#8217;s
have breakfast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This meal over, Norman and Roy accompanied
Colonel Howell out into the city. As
they well know, Edmonton was the town from
which all were forced to take their start into
the northern country and, as the colonel had
already discovered, they soon confirmed the fact
that transportation facilities were in a chaotic
condition. A stage was to leave that day, but
its passenger facilities were wholly inadequate,
and what there were had been engaged for
many days.
</p>
<p>The first visit of the investigators was to
the offices of the Hudson&#8217;s Bay Company, that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
great trading institution which is at once the
banker and the courier for all travelers in the
great Northwest. Although altogether obliging,
at the present time the Company was helpless.
The agent thought he might arrange for
teams, but it would require several days. Then
Colonel Howell visited the offices of the railroad
contractors, where he ascertained definitely
that passage on the construction train was out
of the question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we&#8217;ll have to stay here until the mud
dries,&#8221; laughed Colonel Howell.
</p>
<p>The two boys almost groaned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But something may turn up,&#8221; continued
Colonel Howell, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll be enough to look
after things. You boys had better take a run
over town. If I don&#8217;t see you at noon, I&#8217;ll see
you at dinner this evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys returned to the hotel, found that
Mr. Zept and his son had finally gone out with
friends, and they put in the rest of the day
inspecting the lively young city.
</p>
<p>Colonel Howell&#8217;s acquaintances were not confined
to the Northwest&mdash;he also had friends
in Winnipeg. After leaving the contractors&#8217;
offices, he went to the Dominion Telegraph
Building and sent this message to a business
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
friend in Winnipeg: &#8220;Please see the Canada
Northern officials and tell them that I am
stranded in Edmonton with a party of friends
and would like to get to Athabasca Landing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In two hours, he was called up at the hotel
by the general superintendent of that road, located
in Edmonton, who said he had just been
ordered by the Winnipeg officials to extend
every facility to Colonel Howell and his friends
in their advance to Athabasca Landing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re running a mixed train to a little village
twenty-five miles out from Edmonton,&#8221; explained
the superintendent, &#8220;and when it goes
again, Wednesday morning, I&#8217;ll put an extra
car on this train. Meet me that morning at
eight thirty, at the depot, and I will escort you
personally as far as this train goes. Then I&#8217;ll
arrange to have your car attached to the construction
train. There has never been a passenger
car in Athabasca Landing. You can have
the distinction of finishing your journey in the
first passenger car to touch the great rivers
of the Mackenzie Basin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colonel Howell proceeded at once to the
superintendent&#8217;s office, expressed his gratitude
at the courtesy shown, and arranged that the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
other cars containing his outfit and the airship
should be carried through at the same time.
</p>
<p>When the members of the party returned to
the hotel late in the afternoon, and received
the news of the happy solution of their difficulty,
congratulations rained on Colonel Howell.
The boys had a new respect for the influence
of the man with whom they were casting their
fortunes and who had so little to say about
himself.
</p>
<p>The effect was a little bit different on the
Count, who had rather persisted all day in a
theory of his own that automobiles were the
things to be used. He had canvassed liveries
and accosted chauffeurs, but he had made no
practical advance in securing help of this kind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our own private car!&#8221; was one of Norman&#8217;s
outbursts. &#8220;That&#8217;ll be great.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the first one into the North!&#8221; added
Roy. &#8220;That&#8217;s greater yet. And it gives us
another day in Edmonton.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which isn&#8217;t very great,&#8221; commented the
Count. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen all I want to of this place.
It&#8217;s nothing but banks and restaurants. What&#8217;s
Athabasca Landing like, Colonel Howell?&#8221; he
added a little petulantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the Landing&#8217;s nothing but saloons and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
the river, and beyond it,&#8221; he added significantly,
&#8220;there&#8217;s nothing but the river.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At seven o&#8217;clock that evening, Mr. Zept and
Colonel Howell with the three boys attended a
baseball game, leaving it at nine thirty in full
daylight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow is vacation,&#8221; explained Colonel
Howell, as they separated for the night,
&#8220;and Wednesday at eight thirty we&#8217;ll board
our private car.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>A TEMPESTUOUS VOYAGE TO ATHABASCA LANDING</h3>
</div>

<p>During their stay in Edmonton, the two
Indian rivermen had been living royally in
a lodging house near the depot. Early on the
morning of the departure, Colonel Howell
rounded up his old employees and when the
mixed freight and passenger train backed up
to the depot, the party was ready to board it.
It was with satisfaction that all saw two Chicago
&amp; North Western freight cars, which Colonel
Howell identified as those containing his oil
outfit, and next to the extra passenger coach,
the special baggage car.
</p>
<p>A mist was falling and it was not cheerful.
It was time for Mr. Zept to take his leave. For
some moments he and Colonel Howell spoke
apart and then, without any special word of admonition
to his son, he grasped the hand of each
boy in turn.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll all be friends,&#8221; was his general
good-bye, &#8220;and that you&#8217;ll all stand by
each other. Good-bye. Colonel Howell is my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
friend and I advise all of you to do just as he
tells you. Take care of yourselves,&#8221; and with
no further words, the rich ranch owner helped
the little party to load its baggage into the
express car.
</p>
<p>There were many curious people at the
depot, among whom, not the least conspicuous,
were Moosetooth and La Biche. Men from the
frontier and a dapper young mounted policeman
all came to speak to the two Indians.
</p>
<p>With most of the passengers either hanging
out of the car windows or jammed together on
the platforms&mdash;for at the last moment, Colonel
Howell had readily given his consent to the
superintendent that he might also throw open
the special car to the general public, as far at
least as Morineville, the end of the passenger
run&mdash;the creaking train crawled around a bend,
and while the boys and Colonel Howell waved a
farewell to Mr. Zept, the journey northward
on the new road began.
</p>
<p>The privacy of the special car at once disappeared.
The unusual jam was due to the
impassable condition of the stage trail. Into
the special car there came not only hunters and
traders, but many women and children who had
prevailed upon the railway officials to help them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
forward on the last stage of their journey into
the river land.
</p>
<p>As the pitching train made its way slowly
beyond the city limits, Norman, Roy and Paul
also found themselves on the platform, ready
for the first sight of a new country. They
were looking for sterile plains. Instead, they
found black land freely dotted with clumps of
trees, with walls of wild flowers on each side
of the track. Magnificent strawberries almost
reddened the ground, while, by the fences, the
ripening Saskatoon berry gave the first positive
sign of the new vegetation of which they were
to see so much.
</p>
<p>For three hours the train crept forward,
stopping now and then at little stations, and
at last reached the considerable settlement of
Morineville. Here, Colonel Howell expected to
meet the construction train to which the special
car was to be attached, and from this point they
were to make the remainder of their journey
of seventy-five miles to Athabasca Landing
as the sole passengers of their car.
</p>
<p>But bad news awaited the travelers. The
construction train had not arrived but it was
expected during the afternoon. The superintendent,
taking leave of his guests, left orders
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
that their car should be forwarded on the returning
construction train and at noon he left
on the passenger train for Edmonton. Colonel
Howell&#8217;s car was switched onto a spur and then
began a wait for news of the construction train.
</p>
<p>An affable telegraph operator did what he
could to appease the anxious travelers. By
telephone he learned that the expected train had
not yet made half the journey between Athabasca
Landing and Morineville, and in that distance
had been off the track four times. On the
operator&#8217;s suggestion, the adventurers made
their way to the village for dinner and then returned
to their car and spent the afternoon in
hearing from time to time that the construction
train was off the track again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Promises well for a night ride!&#8221; suggested
Roy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t mean anything,&#8221; explained Colonel
Howell. &#8220;They just slap down an iron
frog and run on again. Don&#8217;t get scared about
that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When time for supper arrived, the agent
gave it as his judgment that the train couldn&#8217;t
get in before midnight and, in that event, that
it certainly would not go back until the next
morning. Being assured by this employee that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
in case his theory was not correct he would
send them word, the party abandoned their car
to have supper and sleep in a little French
hotel.
</p>
<p>The supper was bad and the beds were worse.
Norman and Roy longed for their new blankets
and the woods, and slept with difficulty. Some
time, about the middle of the night, the two
boys heard the strident shriek of a locomotive.
They at once rushed to Colonel Howell&#8217;s room,
eager to make their way back to the depot, but
recalling the operator&#8217;s promise, the prospector
persuaded them to go to bed again and when
it was daylight they all awoke to find no train
in sight. But the operator was waiting for
them and ate breakfast with the party.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She come in with a busted cylinder,&#8221; he
exclaimed, &#8220;and they had to go to Edmonton
to get &#8217;er fixed. But she&#8217;ll be back this morning
sometime and you&#8217;ll have a nice ride to the
Landing.&#8221; Then he laughed. &#8220;That is, if you
can pull a heavy passenger coach over them
tracks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was eleven o&#8217;clock when the old-fashioned
engine reappeared but any motive power
seemed good enough and when the little Irish
conductor read his orders, he cheerfully busied
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
himself in making the passenger car and the
three other cars a part of his train. The spirit
of discontent disappeared and once again the
northbound expedition was on its way.
</p>
<p>Until twelve o&#8217;clock that night, the indefatigable
little Irishman pushed his heavy train,
which included many cars of long-delayed
freight, over the new tracks, which alternately
seemed to float and sink into the soft sand and
muskeg. Four times in that journey some one
car of the train slid off the track and just as
often the energetic crew pulled it back again.
Once the accident was more serious. When the
piling-up jarring told that another pair of
wheels were in the muskeg and the train came
to a crashing stop, it was found that the front
axles of the car had jammed themselves so far
rearward that the car was out of service. But
again there was little delay. With two jack
screws, the little Irishman lifted the car sideways
and toppled it over. Coupling up the
other cars, the train proceeded.
</p>
<p>At six o&#8217;clock in the evening supper was
found in the cook car of a construction camp.
It did not grow dark until eleven o&#8217;clock, and
by this time, Colonel Howell and his friends
were beginning to get a little sleep curled up
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
on the seats of their car. An hour later, having
creakingly crossed a long trestle, the strange
train, still bumping and rattling, made its way
along the even newer and worse track which
led into Athabasca Landing.
</p>
<p>There were neither depot nor light to make
cheer for the tired travelers. With the help
of Moosetooth and La Biche and a few half-breeds,
the considerable baggage of the party
was dumped out onto the sand of the new roadway
and then, all joining in the task, it was
carried across the street to the new Alberta
Hotel. For the first time the boys discovered
that there was almost a chill of frost in the
air; in the office of the hotel a fire was burning
in a big stove and from the front door Colonel
Howell pointed through the starlight to
a bank of mist beyond the railroad track.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There she is, boys,&#8221; he remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean the river?&#8221; exclaimed Roy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our river now,&#8221; answered their elder.
&#8220;There&#8217;s plenty of room here and good beds.
Turn in and don&#8217;t lose any time in the morning.
We&#8217;ve got nothing ahead of us now but
work. And remember, too, you&#8217;re not in the
land of condensed milk yet; you&#8217;ll have the best
breakfast to-morrow morning you&#8217;re going to
have for many a day.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>Moosetooth and old La Biche had already
disappeared toward the misty riverbank.
</p>
<p>Dawn came early the next morning and with
almost the first sign of it Norman and Roy
were awake. From their window they had their
first sight of the Athabasca. A light fog still
lay over the river and the three-hundred-foot
abrupt hills on the far side. Had they been
able to make out the tops of these hills, they
would have seen a few poplar trees. A steep
brown road that started from the end of a ferry
and mounted zigzag into the fog, was the beginning
of a trail that at once passed into a desolate
wilderness. They were within sight of the
endless untraveled land that reached, unbroken
by civilization, to the far-distant Arctic.
</p>
<p>Beneath the fog the wide river slipped southward,
a waveless sheet moving silently as oil,
and whose brown color was only touched here
and there by floating timber and the spume of
greasy eddies.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very cheerful looking,&#8221; was Norman&#8217;s
comment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Roy, &#8220;she&#8217;s no purling
trout-brook; she couldn&#8217;t be and be what she
is&mdash;one of the biggest rivers in America.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys dressed and hurried through the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
new railroad yards to the muddy banks of a big
river. The town of Athabasca Landing lay at
their backs. The riverbank itself was as crude
and unimproved as if the place had not been a
commercial center for Indians and fur men
for two hundred years.
</p>
<p>To the left there was an exception, where,
close on the riverbank, white palisades inclosed
the little offices and warehouse of the Northern
Transportation Company. Just beyond this, a
higher and stronger palisade protected the
riverbank from the winter ice jam. To the right
and down the river a treeless bank extended,
devoid of wharves and buildings. Opposite
the main portion of the town, in this open space,
a steamboat was approaching completion on
crude ways. Near this there were a few
ancient log cabins, used for generations by the
Hudson&#8217;s Bay Company as workshops and
storehouses.
</p>
<p>Three blocks to the west and in the heart
of the new city the old historic H. B. Company
was then erecting a modern cement and pressed
brick store, probably at the time the most
northern expression of civilization&#8217;s thrift.
Still farther to the south the river swerved in
a bend to the east and lost itself beyond a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
giant sweep of hills. Not the least suggestive
objects that came within the two boys&#8217; hasty
view were a few Hudson&#8217;s Bay flatboats, moored
to the bank and half full of water to protect
their tarred seams. In craft such as these, Norman
and Roy, with their friends, were now
about to venture forth on the river flowing
swiftly by them, and not even the new steamboat
was as attractive as these historic &#8220;sturgeon
heads.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Also, in the far distance, on the riverbank
where it curved toward the east, the young
adventurers could make out the thin smoke of
camp fires where a few tents and bark shacks
marked the settlement of the river Indians.
Here they knew Moosetooth and La Biche
had passed the night.
</p>
<p>Colonel Howell&#8217;s prediction as to the breakfast
was fully confirmed. After this, real activity
began at once. Norman and Roy knew that
they had reached the end of civilization, and
had already abandoned city clothes. Both the
boys appeared in Stetson hats, flannel shirts,
belts, and half-length waterproof shoes.
</p>
<p>Colonel Howell made no change other than to
put on a blue flannel shirt. The young Count
made a more portentous display. When he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
rejoined the others after breakfast, he wore a
soft light hat, the wide brim of which flapped
most picturesquely. His boots were those of a
Parisian equestrian, high-heeled like those of a
cowboy, but of varnished black leather. His
clothing was dark, and the belted coat fitted him
trimly.
</p>
<p>Colonel Howell left at once to give orders
about the placing of his cars, and Norman and
Roy were dispatched to the Indian camp to
find Moosetooth and La Biche, who were to
go a short distance up the river and bring the
waiting flatboats down to a point opposite the
freight cars. This duty appeared to interest
young Zept and he cheerfully joined the other
boys in their task.
</p>
<p>Opposite the new steamboat they passed a
larger and noisier hotel, in front of which were
collected many curious people of the country,
many of whom were lazy-looking, slovenly-garbed
half-breeds.
</p>
<p>Young Zept was full of animation, spoke
jovially to any one who caught his eye and,
although it was early in the day, suggested that
his young friends stop with him in the bar
room. But Norman and Roy&#8217;s whole interest
was in the task before them and when they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
saw the Count abruptly salute a red-jacketed
mounted policeman who was standing in the
door of the hotel, they hurried on without even
the formality of declining Paul&#8217;s invitation.
</p>
<p>By the time the old steersmen had been
found, the Count was out of their minds.
Although the riverbank was sticky with mud,
there was an exhilarating crispness in the air
and the river fog had now disappeared. Led
by the two Indians, the boys made their way
a half mile up the river. Here, on a high clean
bank, stood the big red river warehouse of the
H. B. Company. Among the willow bushes opposite
it was a fleet of new &#8220;sturgeon heads,&#8221;
and just below these, two boats that had been
put aside for Colonel Howell.
</p>
<p>From among the bushes near the warehouse
the two Indians produced a pump and then for
two hours took turns in drawing the water from
the half submerged boats. Just before noon,
Moosetooth taking his place in the stern of
the rear boat with a small steering oar, La Biche
loosened the craft and Norman and Roy were
on their first voyage in the historic flatboat of
the Athabasca.
</p>
<p>It was curious to note the skill with which
the veteran riverman allowed the current to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
carry his boats on their way, and the ease
with which they were finally drawn in to the
bank opposite the freight cars.
</p>
<p>Roy proposed to secure a shovel for cleaning
out the mud, but old La Biche laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The sun,&#8221; he said, &#8220;he goin&#8217; do dat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Near the landing, as the boys returned to
the hotel, they discovered a thing they had
not noticed in the morning. A grizzled &#8220;Baptiste,&#8221;
as Norman liked to designate each Indian,
was busy with a draw knife, a chisel and a
maul, finishing steering oars. These enormous
objects resembled telegraph poles, being of pine
timber, slightly flattened at one end to resemble
the blade of an oar, and at the other end cut
down into long handles that the user might
clasp with his two hands.
</p>
<p>When the Indian had roughly trimmed these
giant oars, with the help of an assistant, who
in the meantime seemed to have no other duty
except to puff his charred black pipe, the old
&#8220;Baptiste&#8221; balanced the piece of timber on
a rock. Carefully testing the spar, in order to
get the exact point of equilibrium, the oar
maker then made a rectangular hole through
the six inches of timber. The two boys understood.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>At the rear of each flatboat a steel pin
extended seven or eight inches above the woodwork.
When this pin was thrust through the
hole in the oar, the great sweep hung almost
balanced, and the steersman who used it to
guide the unwieldy craft forced the blade of the
oar back and forth against the current with the
force of his body. The boys found it almost
impossible to lift one of the oars.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see now,&#8221; panted Roy, as he looked
over the tree-like sweep, &#8220;where experience
comes in.&#8221;
</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>COUNT ZEPT MAKES HIMSELF KNOWN AT THE LANDING</h3>
</div>

<p>At the noon meal, Count Zept reported that
Athabasca Landing was certainly a live town.
He explained that he had met the most important
man in town, the sergeant of the mounted
police, and that he had been introduced to many
of the influential merchants. He had examined
the store of the Revillon Freres and was somewhat
disappointed in his inability to secure a
black fox skin which he had promised to send
to his sister.
</p>
<p>The Revillon Freres being the well-known
rival of the Hudson&#8217;s Bay Company, young
Zept in his disappointment had also gone to
the Hudson&#8217;s Bay store, but there he had been
equally unsuccessful, although at both places
he saw plenty of baled skins. Colonel Howell
laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear boy,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;furs do not
go looking for buyers in this part of the world.
Inexperienced travelers seem to have the idea
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
that Indians stand around on the corners waiting
to sell fox skins. Skins are getting to be too
rare for that now and, believe me, the fur companies
get their eye on them before the traveler
can. And the companies pay all they&#8217;re worth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway,&#8221; remarked the Count, &#8220;I can get
a small eighteen-foot canoe for a hundred and
twenty-five dollars. Don&#8217;t you think I&#8217;d better
buy one? The H. B. Company has some fine
ones&mdash;the kind the mounted police use. I was
looking for a bark one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Even the boys smiled at this and Colonel
Howell laughed again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indians don&#8217;t trouble to make bark canoes
any more,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;That is, when
they can buy a good cedar boat. And next to
his blanket, the Indian prizes his wooden boat
above his family. But don&#8217;t bother about a
canoe. Moosetooth has one that we&#8217;ll carry
down the river with us and I&#8217;ve got a good one
at the Fort. Don&#8217;t buy <i>anything</i>. I&#8217;m buying
enough for all of us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the Count could not resist the temptation
and later in the day, when the boys saw
him, he and the sergeant of police were each
wearing a highly embroidered pair of mooseskin
gauntlets that Paul had found in a trading
store.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>Paul had been in the company of this new
friend most of the day and it was apparent
that they had been to the big hotel more than
once.
</p>
<p>After dinner, the unloading of the drilling
machinery, the engine and the airship crates
began. It was a task that Colonel Howell soon
assigned to his young assistants, who had under
their direction a few paid laborers and many
more volunteer laborers who were more curious
than useful. When Colonel Howell turned over
this task to Norman and Roy, he returned to
the outfitting stores and devoted himself anew
to the purchase of supplies.
</p>
<p>On the morning of the second day the loading
of the boats began. Each of these was over
thirty feet long and could hold an immense
amount of freight. It was generally planned
that all of the drilling machinery, the engine,
and some lumber were to go in La Biche&#8217;s boat,
and that the provisions and the airship were
to be carried in Moosetooth&#8217;s batteau. In the
end of each boat there was a little deck the
width of the narrowing end of the boat and
about six feet long.
</p>
<p>While the boats were moving, the decks in the
rear were devoted wholly to the use of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
steersmen, who required all the space as they
occasionally shifted the position of their giant
sweeps. On the forward decks the passengers
must sleep and unless they disposed themselves
on the cargo, find sitting room during the day.
There was neither house nor tent for protection.
A charcoal brazier was provided, on
which at times on the stern deck some cooking
might be done. But in the main, unless the
night was clear and good for running, the boats
were to be tied up while supper and sleep
were had on the shore.
</p>
<p>A part of the equipment of each boat was
six heavy oars. These were for use by the
Indian crew when from time to time it was
necessary to cross quickly over the broad river
to escape rapids or other obstructions. As
these things were revealed to the young aviators,
they grew more and more anxious for the
hour of departure.
</p>
<p>When Colonel Howell&#8217;s outfit began to reach
the riverbank the next morning, Moosetooth
and La Biche had part of their men on hand
to assist in the loading. It was a motley group,
moccasined in mooseskin with their straight
black hair showing defiantly beneath their
silver-belted black hats. Mostly they wore
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
collarless checked flannel shirts and always
from the hip pocket of their worn and baggy
trousers hung the gaudy tassels of yarn tobacco
pouches. Most of them were half-breeds, young
men eager to show the smartness of a veneer of
civilized vices. But this did not bother Colonel
Howell, for Moosetooth and La Biche were alone
responsible and these two men well enacted the
roles of foremen. Sitting idly on the bank, cutting
new pipes of tobacco or breaking twigs,
with slow guttural exclamations they directed
the work to be done.
</p>
<p>The loading began and proceeded wholly
without order. For this reason the prospector
suggested that the airship crates be left until
the last. Bags of flour, of which there were
fifty, were dumped in the bottom of the boat
where the mud and water were sure to spoil
part of the flour.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s the way they do it,&#8221; explained
Colonel Howell. &#8220;It&#8217;s the method of the river
Indians. They&#8217;re doing the work now and don&#8217;t
make suggestions or try to help them. They&#8217;ll
resent it and think less of you for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>While this work was going on, young Zept
appeared from time to time and seemed to be
interested but he as continually absented himself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>Loading went forward slowly. Deliveries of
stores were made several times during the day,
but there was an entire lack of snap and the
Indians took their time in stowing things away.
Colonel Howell was absent most of the day
and in the middle of the afternoon the two
boys took their first opportunity to look over
the town.
</p>
<p>Reaching the main street, they were not surprised
to see the young Count, mounted on a
lively looking pony, dash along the main thoroughfare.
It was hard to tell whether the ease
and surety with which young Zept rode or his
flapping Paris hat attracted more attention. As
the boys waved their hats to him and he gracefully
saluted, they noticed that he must have
been riding for some time. The pony was covered
with perspiration and its nostrils were
dilated. As the rider passed an intersecting
street in the heart of the town, the little animal
made a turn as if preferring another route.
The Count threw it on its haunches and headed
it on down the street at renewed speed.
</p>
<p>A little later, having visited the post office,
Norman and Roy came out just in time to see
young Zept whirling his exhausted mount into
a livery stable. When the boys reached this,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
they found the proprietor, who from his sign
was a Frenchman, and Paul in a heated argument.
It was in vociferous French and in the
course of it the boys saw young Zept excitedly
tear a bill from a roll of money in his hand and
hurl it on the floor of the barn. The proprietor,
hurling French epithets at his customer, kicked
the money aside.
</p>
<p>Norman pushed his way between the spectators
and with assumed jocularity demanded to
know the cause of dispute. In broken English,
the liveryman exclaimed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is no gentleman. He kills my horse.
For that he shall pay two dollars more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; went on Norman
laughing. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that enough? There&#8217;s
your money,&#8221; and he picked up a Canadian ten-dollar
bill and handed it to the owner of the
pony.
</p>
<p>&#8220;His money is nussing,&#8221; retorted the pony
owner. &#8220;He is no gentleman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The absurdity of this must have appealed to
young Zept. Perhaps the presence of his two
companions somewhat shamed him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t have a row,&#8221; broke in Roy. &#8220;The
colonel&#8217;s sure to hear of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Count turned again to the excited
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
Frenchman and began another torrent of apparent
explanation, but it was in a different
tone. He was now suave and polite. As he
talked he held out his hand to the proprietor
of the stable and smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been drinking again,&#8221; whispered Roy
to Norman, a fact which was quite apparent to
the latter.
</p>
<p>Then to the surprise of both boys, with Norman
still holding the money in his hand, the
excited Frenchman grasped his customer&#8217;s
hand, and he and Paul hurried from the barn.
A block away, the disturbed Norman and Roy
saw the two men arm in arm disappear behind
the swinging door of the big hotel bar room.
Ascertaining the amount of their friend&#8217;s bill
from one of the stable employees, Norman paid
it and he and his companion left.
</p>
<p>That evening, Norman handed Paul five dollars
he had received in change and the incident
was closed.
</p>
<p>For three more days the loading of the scows
continued slowly. It finally became apparent
that the little flotilla would set out Saturday
evening. In these days Count Paul&#8217;s manner of
life was so different from that of the boys that
they did not see a great deal of him. Now and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
then he was on the river front, but more frequently
he was a patron of the livery stable,
and even in the evening he was frequently not
in the hotel when Norman and Roy retired.
</p>
<p>His acquaintance with the mounted policeman
put him much in that man&#8217;s company. This
officer, always in immaculate uniform, was very
English in appearance, and he wore a striking
tawny moustache. Being in charge of the local
police station, as the sergeant, he was the highest
police authority in that district. As the boys
noticed him on the street at times, gloved and
swishing his light cane, they were surprised
at the open signs of his indulgence in drink.
But what surprised them even more, knowing
as they now did of the arrangement between
Paul&#8217;s father and Colonel Howell, was the colonel&#8217;s
apparent indifference to young Zept&#8217;s
conduct.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a theory,&#8221; said Norman to his friend
at one time. &#8220;You know Colonel Howell told
us he wasn&#8217;t taking Paul in hand to act as his
guardian. I think he&#8217;s letting him go the pace
until he gets him where he&#8217;ll have to quit what
he&#8217;s doing. Then it&#8217;s going to be up to Paul
himself. If he doesn&#8217;t make a man of himself,
it&#8217;ll be his own fault.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think a good call-down is what he needs,&#8221;
answered Roy, &#8220;and the colonel ought to give it
to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon he thinks that isn&#8217;t his business,&#8221;
commented Norman. &#8220;It&#8217;s certainly not ours.
I reckon it&#8217;ll work out all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Like as not this is Paul&#8217;s idea of roughing
it in the wilds,&#8221; suggested Roy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s hope,&#8221; answered his chum.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll be out of the swing of this in a few
days and when he learns what the real thing
is, if he likes it and takes to it, he&#8217;ll forget this
kind of life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Finally the evening for the departure arrived.
There was no fixed hour, but Colonel Howell&#8217;s
party had an early supper at the hotel and
then a gang of Indians carried their newly
packed equipment to the boats. All these
articles were dropped indiscriminately as the
Indians felt disposed, and soon after six o&#8217;clock
Norman and Roy were ready for the long voyage.
Count Paul had turned his camera over
to the young aviators and their first step was
to make a number of snaps of the boats and
their crews.
</p>
<p>Then, piling their rifles and their new blankets
in the bow of Moosetooth&#8217;s boat, the boys
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
took station on the riverbank, prepared to embark
at any moment.
</p>
<p>In keeping with the methods that they had
found common, it was then discovered that parts
of the provisions had not yet arrived. Colonel
Howell and Paul had not accompanied the boys
directly to the boats. Even after a wagon had
arrived with the last of the provisions, and
these had been distributed by the Indians on
the high heaped cargo, there was yet no sign of
their patron. Nor was Count Zept anywhere
to be seen.
</p>
<p>The Indian wives of the crew sat around
their little tepee fires, but between them and
their husbands passed no sign of emotion or
farewell; this, in spite of the fact that no one
on the boats might expect to return for several
weeks.
</p>
<p>It began to grow cooler and finally the night
fog began to fall over the swift brown river.
</p>
<p>As the sun began to grow less, the barren
hills on the far side of the river turned into
a dark palisade. Finally Colonel Howell appeared.
He had been engaged in settling his
accounts and a merchant who came with him
spent some time in checking up goods already
aboard the scow. But when Colonel Howell
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
learned that the Count was not present he
strolled away almost nonchalantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the way of the North,&#8221; almost sighed
Roy. &#8220;Nothing goes on schedule in this part
of the world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should it?&#8221; grunted Norman.
&#8220;When your journey may mean a year&#8217;s delay
in getting back, what&#8217;s a few minutes more or
less in starting out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was far after nine o&#8217;clock and the sun
was dropping behind the southern hills&mdash;the
air chillier and the fog deeper, when Paul finally
appeared. His boisterous manner was all the
testimony needed to indicate how he had spent
the evening.
</p>
<p>With him was his friend, the sergeant of
police. He had undoubtedly been with his new
comrade to celebrate the departure, but the
dignified officer, being now in the field of duty,
gave few signs of personal indiscretions. For
the first time he was formally presented to all
and in a courteous and high-bred manner extended
to the voyageurs his good wishes for a
safe voyage.
</p>
<p>Before the representative of the law, each
Indian at once sprang to his feet and lifted
his hat. And to each of these in turn the uniformed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
policeman answered in salute. When
it seemed to Norman and Roy that there would
be no end to the long delay, Colonel Howell
also reappeared. With a nod of his head to all,
he spoke quickly in the Cree language to his
steersmen.
</p>
<p>Old Moosetooth grunted a command and the
men ran to the hawsers holding the scows
against the current. Then Moosetooth and La
Biche, without even a look at their unconcerned
families sitting stolidly in the gloom on the
riverbank, took their places in the stern of each
boat. Each began, as he leaned on his oar, to
cut himself a new pipe of tobacco and Colonel
Howell turned to the policeman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sergeant,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;I think we are
ready. Will you examine the outfit?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The tall sergeant bowed slightly and with a
graceful wave of his hand, stepped to the edge
of one of the nearest scows. With a cursory
glance at the mixed cargo of boxes, barrels and
bags&mdash;hardly to be made out in the twilight&mdash;he
turned and waved his hand again toward
Colonel Howell. Then, quite casually, he faced
the two steersmen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bon jour, gentlemen,&#8221; he exclaimed and
lifted his big white hat.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>Colonel Howell and his friends took the
sergeant&#8217;s hand in turn and then sprang aboard
the boat. While the two steersmen lifted their
own hats and grunted with the only show of
animation that had lit their faces, the ceremony
of inspection was over and the long voyage
was officially begun.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE SONG OF THE VOYAGEUR</h3>
</div>

<p>Hardly seeming to move, the deeply laden
scows veered more and more into the current,
until at last the swift flow of the river began
to push them forward. But even before La
Biche&#8217;s boat, which was ahead and farthest
from the shore, was fully in the grasp of a swirling
eddy, the bronzed steersman, his pipe firmly
set in his teeth, hurled his body on the steering
oar and plunged the far end of it against the
oily current.
</p>
<p>At the same moment Moosetooth dropped his
own oar and almost instantly both boats
straightened out before the onrushing waters.
It was a moment long waited for by Norman
and Roy, and at the time no thought was given
to any arrangements for comfort. The boys
threw themselves on the forward deck, their
sweaters close about their throats against the
chilling fog and the cool breeze, while Colonel
Howell sat muffled in his overcoat on the edge
of the deck.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>Such events in the history of the Northern
rivers were in the old days momentous. Their
only ceremony had been the parting &#8220;Bon
jour&#8221; of the policeman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the old days,&#8221; suggested Norman, &#8220;in
the days that our friend Paul would have loved,
the voyageurs had a song for a time like this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The riverman&#8217;s song of farewell,&#8221; spoke
up young Zept with animation. &#8220;I wish I knew
one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Almost instantly, those on the fast-receding
shore heard from the boat the soft notes of some
one in song. Under the conditions, whatever
the words and the air, they floated back as
many of those left behind had heard the old
voyageur take his leave. But this song came
from neither of the weatherworn steersmen,
nor from the stolid members of their half-breed
crew. Count Zept, his hat in his hand and the
cool river wind paling his flushed face, had
mounted to the top of the cargo and was singing
something he had learned in far away lands.
The fascinating tenor of his voice carried far
over the river.
</p>
<p>Even out of the hidden heights on the far
side of the current, the strains of the song came
back with a melancholy pathos. Perhaps the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
young singer himself was moved. But to those
who listened, it wafted over the waters as for
two centuries the voyageurs into the unknown
north had celebrated the setting out of the long
voyage that might have no return. None in the
boat spoke to him, but as he went on, repeating
the lines, and his voice gradually dropping lower
and lower, the boats, lost in the fog and darkness,
swept into the great bend, and the stragglers
on shore turned and left the river.
</p>
<p>Although he did not realize it then, Paul
Zept&#8217;s impromptu tribute in farewell marked
the great turning point in his life.
</p>
<p>Three hundred miles of dangerous water lay
before the travelers and their valuable outfit.
On this part of the voyage the river ran wide
and deep. At the suggestion of the steersmen,
it was at once decided to make no landing that
night but to take advantage of the easy going,
as the cold wind would soon sweep the fog
away. Strongly touched by the air of Paul&#8217;s
song, which the singer laughingly explained
was a song without words, as he had made it up
mainly from snatches of Italian opera, the
words of which he could not recall, Norman and
Roy got Paul on the rear deck and began to
prepare for the night. The assistance of one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
of the crew was necessary to prepare the blankets
in an expert manner. Before midnight
Colonel Howell and the three young men, snugly
wrapped in their new &#8220;four points,&#8221; found
no trouble in losing themselves to the world
without.
</p>
<p>Long before the sun showed itself above the
high poplar-crowned hills that lined each bank
of the Athabasca, Norman and Roy had slipped
out of their blankets. It was their first view
of an absolute wilderness. The boats were still
drifting silently forward, with no sign of life
except in the erect forms of Moosetooth and old
La Biche, who were yet standing against their
long steering oars as they had stood through
the night. Neither of them gave salutation,
Moosetooth&#8217;s dripping oar following in silence
now and then a like sweep of his companion&#8217;s
blade in the water ahead.
</p>
<p>Not arousing their companions, the two boys
perched themselves where Paul had sung the
night before and, shivering in the new day,
began to drink in the scene before them.
</p>
<p>What they saw at that moment was a picture
repeated for nearly two weeks to come.
Although drifting at the rate of four miles an
hour, much time was lost while the boats made
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
their way back and forth across the river, and
although it was but three hundred miles to Fort
McMurray, there was constant delay in camps
ashore, and at the beginning of the Grand
Rapids a week was lost in portaging the entire
cargo. Colonel Howell did not welcome another
lost outfit and he was quite satisfied when both
Moosetooth and La Biche took their empty
scows safely through the northern whirlpool.
</p>
<p>Rising almost from the water, the hills, little
less than mountains in height, ran in terraces.
Strata of varicolored rock marked the clifflike
heights and where black veins stood out with
every suggestion of coal, the young observers
got their first impression of the mineral possibilities
of the unsettled and unknown land into
which they were penetrating.
</p>
<p>The first deer which they observed standing
plainly in view upon a gravelly reef aroused
them to excitement. But when Moosetooth, not
speaking, but pointing with a grunt to a dark
object scrambling up the rocky shelf on the
other side of the river and the boys made out a
bear, Roy sprang for his new twenty-two.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; doin&#8217;,&#8221; called Norman in a low
tone. &#8220;That&#8217;s where we need the .303 and of
course that&#8217;s knocked down.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the use anyway?&#8221; retorted
Roy, resuming his seat. &#8220;I can see there&#8217;s
going to be plenty of this kind of thing. And
besides, you can bet our friend here isn&#8217;t going
to stop for a bear, dead or alive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>From that time on, although they did not find
animals so close together again, they saw eagles,
flocks of wild geese floating ahead of them on
the river, and three more deer. And continually
the magnificent hills, hanging almost over the
river, gave them glimpses of vegetation and
objects new to them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad I came,&#8221; remarked Norman, &#8220;but
I wonder how this country looks when winter
comes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know how this river&#8217;ll look,&#8221; answered
Roy. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be a great, smooth roadway and a
lot of people waitin&#8217; now to get back to civilization
will make it a path for snowshoes and
dog sleds.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some trip up here from Fort McMurray,&#8221;
suggested Norman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You said it,&#8221; exclaimed Roy. &#8220;But the
colonel won&#8217;t have to make it on foot this winter&mdash;not
with the old <i>Gitchie Manitou</i>, and
this ice road to guide us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked with longing at the crates of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
airship, the two smaller ones of which took up
one side of their own scow, while the others
were lashed diagonally on top of the crate in
the forward boat. The two boats had kept their
relative positions throughout the night.
</p>
<p>Just as the sun began to gild the water in
their wake, Paul stuck his nose out of the blankets.
All had slept in their clothes during the
night, Colonel Howell having promised them a
chance at their pajamas on the following evening.
There was no dressing to be done and
when Paul joined his companions all made
preparation to souse their faces over the edge
of the boat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One minute,&#8221; exclaimed Norman. He dug
among his baggage and in a short time reappeared
with the aluminum basin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Non! Non!&#8221; came from the statuelike
figure of old Moosetooth. Then he pointed
to the abrupt cut bank of the river a few hundred
yards ahead and called something in the
Cree language to La Biche. The latter nodded
his head and in turn called aloud in the Indian
tongue.
</p>
<p>Instantly from between the pipes and crates
on the forward boat a dozen half-breeds crawled
sleepily forth. One of these, with a coil of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
rope, sprang into the bow of the forward scow,
and another similarly equipped took his place
in the rear of La Biche, as if ready to spring on
the second scow when opportunity presented.
Both boats were headed for the cut bank.
</p>
<p>The commotion aroused Colonel Howell, and
while he gave a nod of approval, the scows
drifted in under the sweep of the steersmen&#8217;s
oars where the deep water ate into the tree-covered
shore.
</p>
<p>As La Biche&#8217;s boat touched the bank and the
second scow ran forward, the two half-breeds
scrambled onto the roots of the trees and before
the scows could bump away into the stream
once more, they had been skillfully snubbed
around the trunks of the nearest trees, a third
Indian springing from the forward boat onto
Moosetooth&#8217;s craft and making fast a line
thrown him from the shore. Then while the
two boats bumped and struggled to turn their
free ends into the current, the other Indians,
with the skill of long experience, swiftly transferred
hawsers from the free ends of the scows
to other trees.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; shouted Paul, after the first excitement
was over. &#8220;Whatever we&#8217;re going to
do, I hope&#8217;ll be short and sweet,&#8221; and he waved
his arms violently about his head.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>The close vegetation of the shore was alive
with mosquitoes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about these,&#8221; laughed Roy.
&#8220;This is the breeding place of the best mosquitoes
in the world. Don&#8217;t fight &#8217;em&mdash;forget
&#8217;em.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colonel Howell, near by, exclaimed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, young men. Mosquito time
is about over. You won&#8217;t see many of them
after the end of July.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; interrupted Norman, &#8220;what
day is this? Is it July yet?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s another thing you don&#8217;t need to
worry about,&#8221; went on Colonel Howell with a
chuckle. &#8220;When the mosquitoes have gone,
you&#8217;ll know that July is gone, and then we won&#8217;t
have anything to trouble us till the ice comes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bum almanac,&#8221; commented Roy. &#8220;Mostly
gaps, I should say.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so much,&#8221; continued the colonel still
laughing. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t as much of a gap between
the mosquitoes and ice as you might think. But
it&#8217;s breakfast time. We&#8217;ve got two cooks with
us, one for the crew and one for the cabin passengers.
You&#8217;d better take your morning dip
and then, if you like, you can take the canoe and
pull over to that gravel reef. You won&#8217;t find
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
so many mosquitoes there and you can stretch
your legs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys put off their swimming until they
had reached the island, where they had the
satisfaction of arousing a young buck from the
poplar underbrush, and the mortification of trying
to catch it by chasing it toward the mainland
in a canoe. An Indian fired at the deer
from one of the scows, but it made the river
bank in safety and disappeared in the bush.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There, you see,&#8221; announced Roy at once.
&#8220;The twenty-two would have been all right,
but you&#8217;ve got to have it with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The colonel&#8217;s prediction was true and the
three young men had a dip in the shallow
water off the island that was certainly bracing.
When they returned to the shore they found
both cooks in full operation a few hundred yards
from the scows and on the open riverbanks.
</p>
<p>The difference in the output of the cooks was
considerable, but satisfactory to each party
served. The colonel&#8217;s party was making the
best of fresh eggs, fresh butter and new bread
and a beefsteak, which would be their only fresh
meat for many days. The crew, out of a common
pan, helped themselves to boiled potatoes
and fried pork, to which each man appeared to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
add bannock from his own home supplies. The
Indians drank tea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; remarked Colonel Howell, as
he lifted a tin of steaming coffee, &#8220;here&#8217;s to a
friend of civilization&mdash;delicious coffee. We
will know him but a few days longer. He will
then give way to the copper kettle and tea.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How about fresh eggs and beefsteak?&#8221;
laughed Paul.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eggs, my dear sir, have always been a
superfluous luxury patronized mostly by the
infirm and aged. As for beefsteak, it cannot
compare with a luscious cut of moosemeat, the
epicurean delight of the Northwest. It is a
thing you may not have at the Waldorf, and a
delicacy that not even the gold of the gourmet
may lure from the land of its origin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How about bear meat?&#8221; asked Roy, recalling
with some concern his lost opportunity
in the early dawn.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather than starve, I would eat it,&#8221; responded
Colonel Howell, &#8220;and gladly. But to
it I prefer rancid salt pork.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In such badinage, the leisurely stop passed
while the boys finished their first meal in the
wilderness, topping it off with the luscious red
raspberries that were just in perfection all
around the camp.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>That day the boats drifted fifty miles, luncheon
being eaten on the rear deck. A night landing
was made on a gravelly island to escape
as far as possible the many mosquitoes. Tents
were not erected but alongside a good fire the
blankets were spread on the soft grass beneath
the stunted island trees and with mosquito nets
wrapped about their heads all slept comfortably
enough.
</p>
<p>Where the Indians slept no one seemed to
know. When the boys and their patron turned
in as dark came on, at eleven o&#8217;clock, the half-breeds
were still eating and smoking about their
removed camp fire. In this manner, with no
accidents, but with daily diversions in the way
of shooting, venison now being one of the daily
items of food, the voyageurs at last reached the
Grand Rapids.
</p>
<p>From this place, for sixty miles, a tumultuous
and almost unnavigable stretch of water
reached to the vicinity of Fort McMurray, the
end of their journey. The greatest drops in the
water and the most menacing perils were encountered
at the very beginning of the Rapids,
where for half a mile an irregular island of
rock divided the stream. On one side of this
the river rushed in a whirlpool that no craft
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
could attempt. On the other side, and the wider,
skilled boatmen had a chance of safely conducting
light craft through the many perils. Here
it was necessary that both boats should be unloaded
and the entire outfit be portaged to the
far end of the island.
</p>
<p>But travel on the river was so important
that those concerned in it had, many years before,
constructed a crude wooden tramway
which, repaired by every newcomer, was available
for use in transporting the heavy freight.
</p>
<p>Permanent camp was made at the head of
the island when this arduous task began. It
had taken four days to load the boats and seven
days were spent on the island in getting the
cargoes of the two boats to the far end. The
sixth day fell on a Sunday, when no Indian
does any labor. On the afternoon of the next
day Moosetooth and La Biche made their
spectacular races down the Rapids. Not a boy
of the party that did not entreat Colonel Howell
to let him go with the first boat, but in his
refusal their patron was adamant. The only
man to accompany each boat as it started on its
flight was an experienced member of the crew
who sat on the bow with a canoe practically in
his lap. He was ready to launch this any moment
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
to rescue the steersman, but both attempts
were engineered by the veteran river men with
no other bad results than the shipping of a
great deal of water.
</p>
<p>Paul posted himself opposite the most dangerous
point and made pictures of the tossing
boats and their bareheaded pilots as long as they
were in sight.
</p>
<p>Then came the laborious task of reloading
the boats, but under Colonel Howell&#8217;s direct
attention, this operation now took far less than
four days. Within ten hours&#8217; travel from the
foot of the Rapids, the boats rounded a bend at
three o&#8217;clock the next afternoon and came in
sight of a lone cabin on the bare and rocky
shore of the river.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look in the trees behind it,&#8221; exclaimed
Colonel Howell.
</p>
<p>Like a gallows, almost concealed behind a
fringe of poplar trees, stood the familiar lines
of an oil derrick.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry they haven&#8217;t got a flag out,&#8221; remarked
Colonel Howell, &#8220;but that&#8217;s the place.
All there is of Fort McMurray is just beyond.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>PAUL AWAKENS TO THE SITUATION</h3>
</div>

<p>At first Colonel Howell&#8217;s camp appeared to
be deserted, but as the boats made in toward
the shore and the crew began shouting, two
men appeared from the cabin. These were
Ewen and Miller&mdash;Chandler was not in sight.
</p>
<p>The new log cabin with its flat tar-paper roof,
glistening with its many tin washers, and with a
substantial looking chimney built against one
end, had a satisfactory look. In addition, several
large ricks of cordwood standing at the
edge of the clearing gave sign that the men had
not been idle during the spring. At the same
time, there were many evidences of a lack of
thrift to be seen in the debris left from the
cabin building.
</p>
<p>No arrangements had been made for a boat
landing and Colonel Howell&#8217;s canoe was lying
carelessly against the steep bank. Both Norman
and Roy felt somewhat disappointed. While
neither was bothered with the romantic ideas
usually attached to the woodland cabins of fiction,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
each had expected a smarter camp. Nor
were they very favorably impressed with the
two men who appeared on the bank. They were
not exactly tidy in appearance and their figures
and faces suggested that they had spent a winter
of comparative ease among the colonel&#8217;s
stores.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the Englishman?&#8221; was Colonel
Howell&#8217;s salutation, as he and his friends
sprang ashore.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Over at the settlement,&#8221; answered Ewen,
as he jerked his thumb down the river. &#8220;There
wasn&#8217;t much doing here and he went over there
a few days ago to visit some friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A few days ago,&#8221; exclaimed the colonel,
as his eyes made a survey of the littered-up
clearing. &#8220;He might have put in a little time
clearin&#8217; out these stumps.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We just got through cuttin&#8217; the wood,&#8221;
broke in Miller as he and Ewen shook hands
with their boss, &#8220;and we just got the finishin&#8217;
touches on the cabin. We didn&#8217;t know when to
expect you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colonel Howell, followed by his men and the
new arrivals, scrambled up the bank and, with
no great show of enthusiasm, began a close
examination of the new cabin and its surroundings.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
Nor were the boys any more impressed
with the structure, which, inside, showed very
little ingenuity. It had been made for the use
of four men&mdash;seven were going to crowd it.
After Colonel Howell had inspected the derrick,
he returned and seated himself on a stump.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When&#8217;s Chandler comin&#8217; back?&#8221; he asked
abruptly. Without waiting for a reply, which
neither of his men seemed able to give him, he
added: &#8220;One of you fellows had better take
the canoe and go and get him this afternoon&mdash;that
is, if he wants to come back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was some irritation in his tone that
showed everyone that things were not exactly
to his liking.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only two miles,&#8221; remarked Ewen showing
some alacrity, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll go by the trail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When he had gone, Colonel Howell turned to
Miller, whose unshaven and somewhat bloated
face told that he had not lost any flesh during
his stay at the camp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miller,&#8221; he said, &#8220;go down and take hold
of these scows. We&#8217;ve got to get this stuff
up here on the bank and under some protection.
I don&#8217;t want these Indians on my hands
any longer than necessary. Keep &#8217;em at it until
midnight, if necessary, and then make up an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
outfit for &#8217;em to-morrow and let &#8217;em hit the
trail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with the boats?&#8221;
asked Roy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to use &#8217;em to make a cabin
big enough for our new family,&#8221; answered
the colonel, smiling perfunctorily. &#8220;This one&#8217;s
all right for our cooking and eating, but it
doesn&#8217;t appeal to me as a bunk house. I think
we&#8217;ll add another room. The season&#8217;s getting
away from us and we can&#8217;t afford to lose any
time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man Miller had already shown signs
of great activity when Colonel Howell suddenly
called him back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;On second thought, Miller,&#8221; he said, rising
and throwing off his coat, &#8220;I think you&#8217;d better
tackle the cabin first. There&#8217;s a lot of truck
in there that ought to be in a storehouse and it&#8217;s
got a kind o&#8217; musty smell. Open all the windows
and clean out the place. We&#8217;ve got to
sleep in there to-night. When you&#8217;ve done that,
get that kitchen stuff and use some river water
and sand on it. Looks like an Indian shack
in the middle o&#8217; winter. Young men,&#8221; he went
on, again forcing a smile, &#8220;I reckon it&#8217;s up to
us to get this gang busy.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>
<p>There was nothing in this that discouraged
Norman and Roy and even Paul seemed interested
in the unloading of the boats. Before this
was begun, however, Moosetooth spoke in an
undertone to Colonel Howell and, shrugging
his shoulders, the prospector waved his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;they&#8217;ll work
the better for it. Feed &#8217;em. Four meals a
day&mdash;that&#8217;s the least that any half-breed
demands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>While Colonel Howell and the crew began
getting the two scows broadside along the bank,
the Cree cooks unloaded the two cook outfits
and the grub boxes. The laborious task of
hoisting the crates and boxes of the rest of the
cargo up the treacherous bank had hardly begun
when the cooks, disdaining the fireplace within
the cabin, had their fires going in the open
clearing.
</p>
<p>Within an hour the Indians were devoting
themselves to a filling supper and a little later
Colonel Howell and his assistants made a hasty
meal of tinned roast mutton, pickles, Indian
bannock, and tea. All about was confusion.
The personal baggage of the newly arrived had
been assembled just without the cabin door and
Miller and a couple of the crew were beginning
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
to carry in balsam boughs, on which, in their
blankets, the colonel and his friends were to
pass the night.
</p>
<p>No attempt was made, further than Miller&#8217;s
crude efforts, to make the inside of the cabin
more inviting. A big fire of rotten wood had
been started near by, as a mosquito smudge, but
all were too busy to give these pests much
attention.
</p>
<p>While the Indians were at supper, Ewen returned
with Chandler.
</p>
<p>The latter arrived with much effusiveness,
but his greeting by Colonel Howell was rather
curt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you&#8217;ll remember this,&#8221; the
colonel remarked, &#8220;when it comes to settling.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Chandler changed his attitude instantly. His
expression and speech showed that he was not
sober.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready to settle now,&#8221; he retorted, as
his eyes swept over the growing heaps of the
many boxes, barrels, bags and crates that littered
the shore.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I am too,&#8221; remarked Colonel Howell,
&#8220;when it suits me. Meanwhile, you&#8217;re off
the chuck roll. Get out of camp and when
you&#8217;re in a proper condition and can show me
what you&#8217;ve earned, come back!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>The tall and emaciated Englishman drew himself
up and glared at Colonel Howell.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out!&#8221; exclaimed the latter in a tone
that was wholly new to the three boys.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go when I get my money!&#8221; mumbled
Chandler, half defiantly.
</p>
<p>Without more words, Colonel Howell shot out
his right arm and caught the man by his shoulder.
He whirled Chandler and sent him sprawling
on the trail.
</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s defiance was gone. &#8220;My pay&#8217;s
comin&#8217; to me,&#8221; he whimpered, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve
worked hard for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see about that,&#8221; snapped the oil
man, &#8220;when the time comes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As if dismissing the incident from his mind,
he turned toward the scows.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221; exclaimed the three boys,
almost together, but their warning was hardly
needed. As Colonel Howell turned, the sinewy
form of old Moosetooth had thrown itself upon
the crouching Englishman. The two men sank
to the ground and there was a surge forward
by those near by. Then the Indian tore himself
from the partly helpless Chandler and
struggled to his feet. In his hand he held
Chandler&#8217;s short double-edged knife. With indistinguishable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
imprecations and his arms waving
in the air, the Englishman disappeared
within the fringe of poplar trees.
</p>
<p>Excited, but with no excuse for asking questions,
the boys turned and, with Colonel Howell,
resumed the task of getting their cargo
ashore. Old Moosetooth looked at the knife,
placed it inside his belt and began cutting a
fresh pipe of tobacco.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Life in the wilds!&#8221; remarked Colonel
Howell, as he and the boys regained the scows.
&#8220;A lazy man&#8217;s bad enough, but a booze fighter
doesn&#8217;t belong in this camp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where could he get anything to drink up
here?&#8221; asked Norman, a little nervously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me!&#8221; responded Colonel Howell.
&#8220;That&#8217;s what we all want to know. Anyway,&#8221;
he went on, &#8220;we&#8217;ve done our part towards cutting
it out. There isn&#8217;t a drop of it in this
outfit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When he could do so without attracting attention,
Norman glanced at Paul. The latter as
quickly averted his eyes and plunged with
greater energy into his share of the work.
</p>
<p>These events had taken place just before
the &#8220;cabin passengers&#8221; had been called to supper.
Efforts were being made to forget the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
Chandler episode and Colonel Howell especially
was talkative and jolly. Paul was just the
opposite. At last, when the cook had left them
with their tea, the young Austrian seemed to become
desperate. Norman and Roy were just
about to leave the cabin when Paul stopped
them, more and more embarrassed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to say something, boys,&#8221; he began.
Then he turned to his host and, the perspiration
thick on his face, added suddenly: &#8220;Colonel
Howell, I don&#8217;t know how to say it, but I&#8217;ve
got to tell you. I lied to you the other night in
the hotel at Edmonton. You didn&#8217;t ask me to
stop drinking, but you talked to me pretty
straight, and that&#8217;s what I meant to do. Well
I didn&#8217;t stop&mdash;I just put it off, a little. I
didn&#8217;t do the right thing back at the Landing.
I knew it then, but I knew I was going to stop
when I came up here and I just put it off a little
longer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The colonel made a half deprecating motion,
as if it embarrassed him to listen to the young
man&#8217;s confession.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it was all right,&#8221; he said, as if to
somewhat relieve Paul&#8217;s embarrassment, &#8220;and
I knew you meant to stop. Of course we knew
what you were doing, but you&#8217;re pretty young,&#8221;
concluded the colonel with a laugh.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>Norman and Roy each gave signs of an inclination
to relieve Paul&#8217;s embarrassment and
Norman especially showed concern. But he and
his friend remained silent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll let that all be bygones,&#8221; suggested
Colonel Howell, &#8220;and here&#8217;s to the future&mdash;we&#8217;ll
drink to what is to come in Canada&#8217;s national
beverage&mdash;black tea reeking with the
smoke of the camp fire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A laugh of relief started round, as Paul&#8217;s
three companions hit the table with their heavy
tin cups, but in this the young Count did not
join.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That ain&#8217;t it,&#8221; he blurted suddenly. &#8220;That
was bad enough, but I&#8217;ve done worse than
that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The colonel&#8217;s face sobered and Norman&#8217;s
eyes turned toward the heap of personal belongings
just outside the cabin door. Paul&#8217;s
trembling arm motioned toward these boxes
and bags.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a case of brandy out there and
I&#8217;ve got to tell you how I&#8217;ve lied to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly that!&#8221; protested Colonel Howell.
&#8220;You hadn&#8217;t spoken to me of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; confessed Paul, his voice
trembling, &#8220;but I just heard you say we hadn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
anything like that with us and I might as well
have lied, because I had it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did that sergeant of police know this?&#8221;
broke in Roy. &#8220;I thought he examined everything.
He certainly said we were all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he knew it,&#8221; answered Paul, &#8220;but he
isn&#8217;t to blame. Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m making that an
excuse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colonel Howell sat with downcast eyes and
an expression of pain on his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you do it?&#8221; he asked in a low
tone at last. &#8220;Did you mean to hide it from
me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; exclaimed his young guest. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know why I did it. I don&#8217;t want it. I&#8217;m
going to quit all that. That&#8217;s why I came up
here. You know that, Colonel Howell&mdash;don&#8217;t
you believe me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Colonel Howell&#8217;s face now bore a different
expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My friend,&#8221; he remarked after a few moment&#8217;s
thought, &#8220;I may have done wrong to
ask your father to let you come with us. I
thought you knew all the conditions. If this is
a life that is not going to interest you, you&#8217;d
better go back. The Indians will be returning
to-morrow or the next day and you won&#8217;t find
it such a hard trip.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></p>
<p>Paul gulped as if choking and then sprang
from the table. From the baggage outside he
extracted a canvas-bound box, his own name
on the side. While his companions sat in silence
he hurled it on the floor at their feet and then,
with a sweep of his knife, cut the canvas from
the package. With a single crush by his heavy
boot, he loosened one of the boards of the cover.
Carefully packed within were a dozen bottles of
expensive brandy. Paul caught one of them and
appeared to be about to smash it on the edge
of the table. The colonel raised his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; ordered his host. &#8220;Are you going
back or do you want to stay with us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel Howell,&#8221; almost sobbed the young
man, &#8220;I&#8217;d give anything I have or can do for
you if you&#8217;ll let me stay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one condition,&#8221; answered
Colonel Howell, and he no longer attempted to
conceal his irritation. &#8220;If you&#8217;re not strong
enough to do without that kind of stuff, you&#8217;re
not welcome here. If you are, you are very
welcome.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll throw it all in the river,&#8221; exclaimed
Paul, chokingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which would prove nothing,&#8221; announced
Colonel Howell. &#8220;Put that bottle back in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
box and nail it up. When you want it again,
come and tell me and I&#8217;ll give you the case and
an escort back to the Landing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The episode had become more than embarrassing
for Norman and Roy and they arose
and left the room. Paul&#8217;s face was buried in
his hands and his head was low on the table.
Fifteen minutes later, the young Count and the
oil man made their appearance, both very sober
of face.
</p>
<p>At midnight when the last of the cargo had
been unshipped, when the Indians had been
fed again and when the white men had had a
late supper of bannock and Nova Scotia butter
and fresh tea, and when Colonel Howell and the
boys had spread their heavy blankets on the
fresh balsam, in Paul&#8217;s corner of the cabin lay
the box that had brought him so much chagrin.
Not once during the evening had the humiliating
incident been referred to by those who participated
in it.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>PREPARING CAMP FOR WINTER</h3>
</div>

<p>Colonel Howell being a far from hard taskmaster,
especially in his dealings with the Indians,
it was not until the morning of the second
day that Moosetooth and La Biche led their men
out of camp on the three-hundred mile tramp
to Athabasca Landing. But the beginning of
work in the camp did not await their departure.
Colonel Howell took time to explain his plans
so far as they concerned his young friends, and
the morning after the arrival of the boats work
at once began with the regularity of a factory.
</p>
<p>The things to be done included a substantial
addition to the present cabin, to be made in the
main out of the straight poplar timber. The
roof of this was to be of sod and the new bunk
house formed a &#8220;T&#8221; with the old cabin. A
clay floor was packed within and on this a board
floor was made of some of the inside timber
from one of the scows. New timber and poplar
posts were used to make the bunks, which,
packed heavily with shredded balsam, soon provided
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
clean and fragrant sleeping berths. Colonel
Howell had learned of a sheet-iron stove
to be had in the McMurray settlement, and this
was to be installed before cold weather arrived.
</p>
<p>The other cabin was renovated and thoroughly
cleaned. A provision storehouse was
added in the rear, and the clay fireplace was
enlarged and extended into the room. This
work under way, Norman and Roy, assisted by
Paul, undertook to construct a rough but
adequate aerodrome. The open space in front
of the cabin was not sufficient for a landing
and a large part of the clearing in the rear of
the cabin was leveled for the airship shed. To
decrease the size of the structure, it was also
made in &#8220;T&#8221; shape, the extension for the tail
of the machine reaching back toward the cabin,
for the new shelter faced away from the cabin
so that there might be no obstacle in starting
and landing the machine.
</p>
<p>In spite of its simple character, the boys made
elaborate sketches for this shed and used in the
main small uniform poplar trees easily carried
on their shoulders. The entire frame of the
building was made of this timber. The front
of it was to be made of the colonel&#8217;s three enormous
tarpaulins. The sides and top being of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
heavy hemlock bark, this feature of the work required
many days and it was often tiresome.
</p>
<p>In the three weeks that this work went on,
Colonel Howell appeared to be in no hurry
to resume his prospecting. The boys learned
that the old Kansas oil men had not been wholly
idle in this respect and that they had located
several good signs, all of which Colonel Howell
took occasion to examine.
</p>
<p>The boys also learned that the best prospects
were not those found where the derrick had
been erected. From their experience, the men
who had been left in camp strongly urged
another location in a dip of land farther inland.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s as good a surface sign as I ever saw,&#8221;
Colonel Howell explained to the young men.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a rock cut, but there&#8217;s enough tar floating
loose to show that there&#8217;s oil mighty close.
But there&#8217;s no use getting excited about it and
tapping a gusher. We&#8217;d only have to cap it
and wait for the tank cars. Everything around
here is prospective, of course. All we can do
is to cover the field and establish our claim.
And I guess that&#8217;s a good winter&#8217;s job.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you goin&#8217; to work this derrick?&#8221;
asked Paul, indicating the one erected near the
camp.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like there might be gas around here,&#8221;
was the colonel&#8217;s laughing response. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
sink a shaft here an&#8217; maybe we can find a flow
of natural gas. That&#8217;d help some when she gets
down to forty below.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was surprising how all these preparations
consumed time. It was nearly the end of
August when these plans had been worked out
and with the setting up of the <i>Gitchie Manitou</i>
in its novel aerodrome and the storing away of
its oil and gasoline in a little bark lean-to, the
camp appeared to be ready for serious work.
</p>
<p>For a week Ewen and Miller had been setting
up the wood boiler and engine for operating
the derrick. From the night he unceremoniously
left camp, Chandler, the Englishman, had
not been heard from.
</p>
<p>Each Sunday all labor ceased in camp and
Ewen and Miller invariably spent the day, long
into the night, in Fort McMurray. The boys
also visited this settlement, which had in it little
of interest. There was no store and nothing to
excite their cupidity in the way of purchases.
They heard that Chandler had gone down the
river, but the information was not definite and,
although Colonel Howell left messages for his
discharged employee, the man did not reappear
and sent no word.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>Colonel Howell&#8217;s other workmen, Ewen and
Miller, were not companionable and did not
become comrades of the boys. Now and then,
in the month&#8217;s work, Norman and Roy had
heard Colonel Howell freely criticize them for
the method of their work or for some newly
omitted thing they had failed to do during the
winter.
</p>
<p>When the stores and supplies had been compactly
arranged in the rear of the living room
and the new storehouse, the cabin and its surroundings
seemed prepared for comfortable
occupancy in the coldest weather.
</p>
<p>The only man retained out of the river outfit
was a Lac la Biche half-breed, a relative of
Moosetooth, who was to serve both as a cook
and a hunter. At least once a week, the entire
party of young men went with Philip Tremble,
the half-breed hunter, for deer or moose. This
usually meant an early day&#8217;s start, if they were
looking for moose, and a long hike over the
wooded hills to the upland.
</p>
<p>One moose they secured on the second hunt
and to the great joy of the boys Philip brought
the skin of the animal back to camp. The
antlers, being soft, were useless. This episode
not only afforded a welcome change in meat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
which, as Colonel Howell had predicted, could
not be told from tender beef, but it sadly interfered
with the work on the aerodrome.
</p>
<p>When the Indian had prepared a frame for
dressing the skin and lashed the green hide
with heavy cord between the four poplar sides
and had produced a shaving knife from somewhere
among his private possessions, the boys
fought for the opportunity to work upon the
hide.
</p>
<p>For almost two days, Norman, Roy and Paul,
by turns, scraped at the muscle, sinews and fat
yet adhering to the skins until at last their first
trophy shone as tight and clean in the sunshine
as a drumhead. Philip had also brought, from
the upland, the animal&#8217;s brains tied up in his
shirt. In the tanning process he then took
charge of the cleaned skin and buried it until
the hair had rotted, and in this condition the
outside of the skin was also cleaned. Then
came a mysterious process of scouring the skin
with the long preserved brains.
</p>
<p>At Colonel Howell&#8217;s suggestion, and with the
complete approval of the boys, this part of the
process was carried on at some distance from
the cabin. Thereafter, when the weather was
clear, Philip exposed the skin to the smoke of a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
smouldering fire, devoting such time as he had
to rubbing and twisting the hide while it turned
to a soft, odorous yellow.
</p>
<p>Before the real winter began, the skin, which
is the wealth of the Canadian Indian, began to
make its appearance in strong moccasins, which
were usually worn around the fireplace and
often in bed.
</p>
<p>From somewhere in the outfit a calendar had
made its appearance, and this had found a
lodging place in the front of the fireplace. The
morning that Colonel Howell made a mark on
September 1, with a bit of charred stick, he
remarked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, boys, the postman seems to have forgotten
us. What&#8217;s the matter with running up
to Athabasca and getting our mail? A piece
of beef wouldn&#8217;t go bad, either. How about
it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>So intense had the interest of Norman and
Roy been in the hundreds of things to be done
in camp that the aeroplane, although not out
of mind, was not always foremost in their
thoughts. No reply was needed to this suggestion.
Instantly, the proposition filled the air
with airship talk.
</p>
<p>This first trip had been discussed many
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
times. It required no particular planning now.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I like to travel about fifty miles an hour,&#8221;
exclaimed Norman, &#8220;and it&#8217;s three hundred
miles to the Landing. We&#8217;ll leave to-morrow
morning at five o&#8217;clock and land on the heights
opposite the town at eleven. One of us&#8217;ll go
across in the ferry&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Both of us,&#8221; broke in Roy. &#8220;There&#8217;s no
need to watch the machine&mdash;everybody&#8217;s
honest in this country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me go and watch it?&#8221; asked Paul, who
was now the constant associate of the other
boys in their work and pleasures.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not this time,&#8221; answered Norman. &#8220;It
isn&#8217;t exactly a bus, you know. We can take
care of it all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll have dinner at the good old
Alberta,&#8221; suggested Roy with his features
aglow, &#8220;do our errands, and start back about
three o&#8217;clock. It&#8217;s a cinch. With the river
for our guide, we ought to give you a beefsteak
about nine o&#8217;clock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t forget a few magazines,&#8221; put
in Paul.
</p>
<p>This flight, which began promptly on time
the next morning, after an early breakfast of
toasted bannock, bacon and the inevitable tea,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
which Philip never spoiled with smoke, however,
was made with all the ease of the exhibitions
at the Stampede.
</p>
<p>The <i>Gitchie Manitou</i> was wheeled out of the
hangar for a thorough inspection. Then the
boys climbed in and the engines were started.
With a wave of the hand they were off.
</p>
<p>For a short time after the yellow-winged
monoplane had mounted and turned south and
westward over the vapory river, the boys had
a new sensation. The rising fog started air
currents which for a time they did not understand.
Perhaps Norman&#8217;s hand was a little
out of a practice and at times Roy showed nervousness.
</p>
<p>When Norman finally guessed the cause, he
mounted higher and took a course over the
uplands where, as the sunshine cleared the
atmosphere, the <i>Gitchie Manitou</i> became more
easily manageable. The line of vapor rising
from the river some distance on their left was
sufficient guide. This at last disappeared in
turn and Norman threw the car back on its old
course.
</p>
<p>Once again above the river, whose brown,
oily surface now shone clearly beneath them,
Roy especially busied himself with the many
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
attractions of the stream. Animal life was
plentiful and, despite Norman&#8217;s renewed protests,
his companion insisted now and then in
fruitlessly discharging his rifle at small game.
</p>
<p>They made better time than fifty miles and
made a safe landing on the heights opposite
Athabasca some time before eleven o&#8217;clock.
What had seemed to them, from Athabasca,
to be an uninhabited bluff, was now found to
contain several poor cabins. Afraid to leave
the car alone near those who would certainly
be curious, Norman decided to stay with the
monoplane and Roy undertook to visit the town
across the river. But dinner at the Alberta was
eliminated and Roy, in addition to his mail and
meat and magazines, was to bring back luncheon
for both the aviators.
</p>
<p>Norman accompanied him to the brow of the
hill and saw him scramble down the winding
road to the ferry landing below. Here, also,
he saw him wait nearly a half hour before the
cumbersome gravity flatboat put out from the
other shore, and then he devoted himself to
picking and eating Saskatoon berries, with
which the hills were covered.
</p>
<p>It was two o&#8217;clock when Roy returned, burdened
with packages. For an hour Norman
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
had been asleep in the invigorating hill air.
Roy had certainly gone the limit in the matter
of meat. He had two roasts and six thick steaks
and, what was more to his own taste, he proudly
displayed a leg of lamb. His mail, of which
there seemed to be a great deal for everyone,
he had tied in one end of a flour sack. In the
other end he had six loaves of fresh bread. On
his back in another bag he had a weight of
magazines.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought we&#8217;d take what we could,&#8221; he
began, &#8220;and I guess it&#8217;s a good thing we came
when we did. Somebody&#8217;s been pounding telegrams
in here for several days for Colonel
Howell. I got a half dozen of &#8217;em and I sent
all he gave me. I got off some messages to the
folks, too, but I wonder what the colonel&#8217;s so
busy about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This ain&#8217;t the only iron he has in the fire,&#8221;
answered Norman drowsily. &#8220;But where&#8217;s our
own eats?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Roy dumped his bags and bundles on the
grass and then began to explore his own capacious
pockets. From one he took a can of salmon
and from another a box of sardines.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And here&#8217;s the lemon for &#8217;em,&#8221; he explained,
producing it from his shirt pocket.
&#8220;Help yourself to the bread.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221; complained Norman. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
bet a nickel you had dinner at the Alberta!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All but this,&#8221; went on Roy, and he began
unbuttoning the front of his flannel shirt. &#8220;It
feels kind of soft.&#8221;
</p>
<p>While Norman watched him, he extracted a
greasy bag, flat and crumpled, and tore it open
to expose what was left of an originally fine hot
raisin pie.
</p>
<p>His companion turned up his nose in disgust.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fell down on the hill,&#8221; explained Roy,
&#8220;but if you don&#8217;t want it, don&#8217;t bother. It&#8217;s
just a little squashed. I&#8217;ll eat it all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Norman began to straighten out the crumpled
pieces with his finger, when his chum added,
with some exultation: &#8220;And these.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then, from within his unbuttoned shirt, he
began to unload a dozen large sugar-coated
doughnuts.
</p>
<p>As Norman&#8217;s mouth began to water, and he
turned to the bread bag, a new odor caught his
nostrils.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; he exclaimed, pulling another
greasy bag from among the bread loaves.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I forgot,&#8221; sputtered Roy, a part of one
of the doughnuts already in his mouth; &#8220;that&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
some baked ham I found at the butcher shop. I
guess that&#8217;s some eats.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you get any pop?&#8221; was Norman&#8217;s
only answer, a look of added disgust spreading
over his face.
</p>
<p>Roy turned, with a startled look: &#8220;I
couldn&#8217;t carry any more,&#8221; he answered a little
guiltily, &#8220;but I drank a couple o&#8217; bottles myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew I&#8217;d get stung if I let you go!&#8221;
growled his companion.
</p>
<p>Norman looked at him with indignation.
Then, having already appropriated a doughnut,
he mounted quickly on the side of the car and
sprang down again with the aluminum basin in
his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you go down to the river and get me
a drink. You&#8217;ve had it soft enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The return trip was almost a duplicate of the
morning flight. In this, however, the aviators
were able to follow the stream itself, and they
flew low, protected from the evening breeze by
the river hills. The ride did not seem long,
and the boys were particularly interested in another
view of the Rapids, which they had been
unable to study in the morning flight. Not a
single human being, going or coming, had they
seen on the long stretch of river.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p>In Athabasca, Roy had learned that their
boat crew had not all returned, but that La
Biche and Moosetooth had reached town and
that both were already serving as pilots on the
new Hudson&#8217;s Bay Company steamer that had
been launched in their absence and was now
making its first trip up the river. They were
almost passing the oil camp when the sound
of a shot attracted their attention and then,
guided by Paul&#8217;s worn and faded hat, they
banked and landed in the rear of the aerodrome
at ten minutes of nine.

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>BREASTING A BLIZZARD IN AN AIRSHIP</h3>
</div>

<p>When Roy turned over his half dozen telegrams
to Colonel Howell, the two boys saw that
the messages were of some significance. A little
later they saw their patron reading them a second
time. But when the beefsteak supper was
served he seemed to have forgotten business.
But that was only his way. When the prospector
had reached his after-dinner cigar, he
said abruptly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you say everything went all right!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Like taking a buggy ride,&#8221; answered Norman.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want us to go oftener? If
it wasn&#8217;t for using up the gas, there isn&#8217;t any
reason why we shouldn&#8217;t meet each mail stage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad o&#8217; that,&#8221; answered Colonel Howell,
smiling. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to have you take a telegram
over for me in the morning and wait for
an answer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think I can go in this time?&#8221;
asked Paul at once.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>The other boys gave him no heed for a
moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We could go to-night,&#8221; volunteered Norman,
&#8220;if you like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That wouldn&#8217;t do any good,&#8221; answered
the colonel. &#8220;You probably couldn&#8217;t get the
operator. I&#8217;ll be more than satisfied if you duplicate
to-day&#8217;s trip&mdash;except as to the meat,&#8221;
he added. &#8220;We&#8217;ve enough of that for some
days.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Paul sat in suppressed excitement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to butt in,&#8221; he urged in the
pause that followed; &#8220;but I want to help all I
can. You don&#8217;t need to be afraid&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys could not resist a glance toward the
bunk house door, where they well knew that
Paul&#8217;s embarrassing box still stood intact. And
both Norman and Roy flushed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can go,&#8221; announced Norman instantly.
&#8220;You won&#8217;t be afraid!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only afraid of disappointing Roy,&#8221; answered
the elated Paul.
</p>
<p>The latter was disappointed, but he gave no
sign of it and when he smiled and waved his
hand, the thing was settled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been holding an option on a fine piece
of oil property near Elgin, Kansas,&#8221; the colonel
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
began in explanation, &#8220;and I had forgotten
that the limit was about to expire. Several of
these telegrams are from my agent, who tells
me we must have the property. The telegrams
are now over three weeks old and I&#8217;ve just got
two days in which to get word to him to buy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Write your message to-night,&#8221; suggested
Norman, &#8220;for we&#8217;ll get away a little earlier in
the morning, since we&#8217;ve got to wait for an
answer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The second flight to Athabasca Landing was
of course Paul&#8217;s first experience in an airship.
For some time he was subdued and Norman
could see his tense fingers gripping the edge
of the cockpit. But when assurance came to
him, he made up for his preliminary apprehension
and was soon taking impossible pictures of
the far-away hills and trees beneath him.
</p>
<p>Reaching the landing place on the Athabasca
Hills, Paul at once said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose you&#8217;d feel better if you looked
after the telegrams yourself. I&#8217;ll stay with the
machine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was the program Norman had outlined
but when the suggestion came from the young
Austrian himself, Norman had not the courage
to humiliate his companion with such a plain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
indication of his fear. Without hesitation, he
answered:
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you talking about? Nothing like
that now! Besides, I want to look over the engine.
You go and attend to things&mdash;I&#8217;ll be
here when you get back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A little after twelve o&#8217;clock, a boy arrived
from the other side of the river, carrying Norman&#8217;s
dinner in a basket. The messenger was
from the Alberta Hotel and he also carried a
note from Paul announcing that no answer had
yet been received to Colonel Howell&#8217;s telegram.
</p>
<p>As the afternoon wore slowly away, Norman
became more and more apprehensive. It was
nearly six o&#8217;clock when Paul came in sight,
breathless and exhausted from his rapid climb
up the hill. Norman could not resist a sigh of
relief when he saw that the delay was not due
to any new indiscretion of the young Austrian.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame you,&#8221; panted Paul, &#8220;and I
bet you&#8217;ve been sweating blood. I don&#8217;t deserve
anything else, but you&#8217;re going to save a
lot of time if you&#8217;ll just forget what I used to
be. I ain&#8217;t going to make any promises, but
I&#8217;ll show all of you that I&#8217;m not what you all
thought I was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Norman only smiled, but he gave his young
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
friend a look of sympathy. Then he announced
a little variation in the general plan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re so late now that it&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be dark
before we get back and a little further delay
won&#8217;t do any harm. Just back of the new H. B.
Company store I remember there&#8217;s quite an
open space on the other side of the town.
We&#8217;re flying pretty light and I think we&#8217;ll
cross the river, make a landing there, and get
a couple of tins of gasoline. We want an extra
supply on hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This flight was easily accomplished but it involved
an experience that Norman had not anticipated.
Having made a safe landing, while
he visited the trading post and arranged to
have oil delivered at once, nearly everyone in
Athabasca Landing seemed to learn of the arrival
of the airship. When he came riding
back to the monoplane, in the delivery wagon,
the <i>Gitchie Manitou</i> was the center of a mob of
curious people. The sergeant of police was
there, as well as the people from the hotel. It
was impossible to leave at once. Politeness
demanded decent replies to many inquiries but
Norman almost felt repaid when he noted that
this was the first meeting during the day between
Paul and his old friend, the Mounted
Policeman.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>Yet, in the midst of the general greeting, the
boys finally took their leave. As they swung
over the city and the river, the mist was beginning
to rise from the latter. For a part
of the return trip at least, Norman knew that
he would have to resort to his compass or to
the guidance of the varying air currents that
marked the river course at night.
</p>
<p>For several days in the latter part of August
there had been nightly frosts. Then there
had been a short spell of warm weather and this
night the boys could see that cool weather
was rapidly approaching. As the monoplane
winged its way into the gathering gloom and
the crisp evening passed into dusk, the body
of the <i>Gitchie Manitou</i> grew wet with cold dew.
After dark, this began to turn into frost. Paul
was able to wrap a light blanket about himself,
but Norman, with no relief present, stuck to
his post, protected only by his gloves and
sweater.
</p>
<p>As it was impossible to make out the course
of the river from any distance, he had to defy
the air currents in the rather hazardous light
between the high river banks. It was far from
the even flight made during the day in the sunlight,
and again Norman could see his companion
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
gripping the edge of the cockpit. There
was little conversation, and in order to divert
his companion, Norman manufactured a job for
Paul by assigning to him the duty of watching
the engine revolution gauge and the
chronometer.
</p>
<p>As Paul flashed the bulbs, throwing their
little shaded lights on these instruments, and
sang out the reading every few moments, Norman
could not resist a smile. He read both instruments
each time as quickly as his assistant.
</p>
<p>About eleven thirty, the sun having now
wholly disappeared, Norman&#8217;s long-waiting ear
caught the unmistakable roar of the head of the
Grand Rapids. From this place, he had a compass
bearing to Fort McMurray, and he could
have predicted their arrival at the camp almost
within minutes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can take it easy now,&#8221; he suggested to
Paul. &#8220;We&#8217;re practically home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When the roar of the Rapids finally ceased,
the river fog cleared somewhat and, with the
help of the stars, the outline of the river became
plainer below.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How much longer?&#8221; asked Paul in a tired
tone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been coming pretty slow,&#8221; was Norman&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
cheery response. &#8220;We&#8217;ll hit her up a bit.
It&#8217;s forty miles to the camp, but we&#8217;ll save a little
by cutting out the big bend. See if I ain&#8217;t
there in three-quarters of an hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d think they&#8217;d have a light for us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If they&#8217;re all asleep,&#8221; answered Norman.
</p>
<p>But they were not asleep. Some apprehension
on the part of even Roy had kept him and
the colonel wide awake. When it grew dark
and the monoplane had not returned, he made
a fire of cordwood and during the long evening
renewed it constantly. At half past one the
<i>Gitchie Manitou</i> concluded its second successful
trip.
</p>
<p>The answer brought to Colonel Howell, in response
to his telegram, appeared to be highly
satisfactory to that gentleman. As he read it
in the light of Roy&#8217;s poplar wood signal fire, he
remarked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you young men that you didn&#8217;t know
how much you might be worth to me. If I
hadn&#8217;t made good on that option, there&#8217;s no
way to tell what I might have lost. I wouldn&#8217;t
let go the deal I made to-day for twenty-five
thousand dollars.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t have anything to do with
it,&#8221; exclaimed the benumbed Paul, &#8220;but I&#8217;m
glad I got a ride at last.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></p>
<p>Colonel Howell opened his mouth as if to
make reply and then checked himself with a
smile. The words behind his lips were: &#8220;And
a month ago you&#8217;d have probably spoiled any
deal you had a finger in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You had as much to do with it as anyone,&#8221;
Norman suggested aloud. Then he laughed
and added: &#8220;But you mustn&#8217;t work so hard.
Look at your hands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Paul opened his yet clenched fingers and held
them before the snapping blaze. The palm of
each hand bore traces of blood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where I lifted her over the high
places,&#8221; he said with a laugh of his own. &#8220;But
look, it&#8217;s dry. I ain&#8217;t been doing it for some
time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This night was the real beginning of the
colder weather. When they were able, in late
July, Ewen and Miller had sacrificed a few potatoes
out of their store to plant a patch of
this vegetable. During August the little garden
had thriven and was at last in full bloom. But
this night, to the keen disappointment of all,
the creamy blossoms fell a victim to the first
blighting frost. From now on, while the days
were even sunnier and often quite warm, the
nights rapidly grew colder and each morning
there were increasing frosts.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>For two weeks preliminary to the removal
of the derrick to the better prospect, the arm
of the drill pounded ceaselessly up and down
all day. There were small accidents that frequently
delayed the work, but no result other
than dulled drills and the accumulation of
promising-looking sand and rock.
</p>
<p>The hunting trips also continued and moose
now became very plentiful. Philip, the cook
and hunter, did not always accompany the boys
on shooting trips, as the half-breed had joined
Ewen and Miller in the work on the well.
</p>
<p>The airship was safely housed, as if for the
winter. The third week in September came in
with a lessening in the daily sunshine. A haze
began to hang over the river valley and a murkiness
now and then took the place of the keen
and clear atmosphere. The evenings had grown
so cool that considerable attention was being
given the fire in the living room.
</p>
<p>On an evening such as this, while Colonel
Howell and his young assistants stood on the
riverbank, watching the red sun turn to silver
gray, Colonel Howell exclaimed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;By our calendar, the fall&#8217;s coming along
a little early. And judging by the trees over
there and the nip in the air, we&#8217;re going to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
have some weather before long. Maybe not for
several days, but it&#8217;s on its way. Before it gets
here, why not make another trip to the Landing
and see if there&#8217;s anything at the post office?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All letters ready at five in the morning,&#8221;
announced Norman impulsively. &#8220;Mail for
Athabasca Landing, Edmonton, Calgary and
points south leaves at that time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better bring a little more beef this time,&#8221;
suggested the colonel with a laugh, &#8220;and anything
else that looks tasty and you&#8217;ve got room
for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ve had all that&#8217;s coming to me,&#8221;
suggested Paul. &#8220;Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m afraid.
Whenever you want a helper,&#8221; he went on,
addressing Norman, &#8220;don&#8217;t fail to call on me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we won&#8217;t make many more trips
this season!&#8221; put in Roy, but in that he was
mistaken. The trip made the next day was
memorable, but two more that were to be made
later were more than that, and the last one was
certainly ample justification for Colonel Howell&#8217;s
daring introduction of the monoplane into
these silent places of the North.
</p>
<p>Shortly before five o&#8217;clock the next morning,
in spite of an ominous gray sky and a new
sound of the wind in the trees, Norman and Roy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
were off on their three hundred mile flight.
They planned a short stay at the Landing and
upon reaching camp again before the shortening
day was at an end. They carried in the cockpit
their Mackinaw jackets and their winter caps.
Philip also prepared a cold luncheon to be eaten
on the return trip, thus saving time at the Athabasca
stop.
</p>
<p>Early on their outward flight, for a time the
red sun made an effort to get through the clouds,
but after nine o&#8217;clock had wholly disappeared
and the temperature began to fall. An almost
imperceptible fine dry snow appeared, but it
was not enough to interfere with the conduct
of the machine. When a landing was finally
made at the old place in the bend of the river,
although the day was dreary enough, only the
chill atmosphere and a few traces of snow gave
premonition of possible storm.
</p>
<p>This time Norman made the visit across the
river and he was not gone much over an hour
and a half. To facilitate the delivery of his
stores, which were considerable, he pressed a
horse and wagon into service and a little after
twelve o&#8217;clock Roy was glad to see his companion
reappear in the delivery wagon. The spitting
snow had begun again. No time was lost
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
in luncheon this day, but the fresh meat, eggs
and butter and a few fresh vegetables were
quickly stored in the rear of the cockpit.
</p>
<p>There were no telegrams this time, but a
larger quantity of mail with considerable for the
boys, some of which Norman had examined.
At twelve thirty o&#8217;clock everything was in readiness.
On the wind-swept heights it was now
cold. Before mounting into the cockpit the boys
put on their winter caps, Mackinaw jackets and
gauntlets.
</p>
<p>Then, elevating the front protecting frame,
they started the <i>Gitchie Manitou</i> on its return
flight, the wind and snow already smiting its
resonant sides in a threatening manner.
</p>
<p>The young aviators had little to say concerning
the situation. They were not alarmed and
could not afford to be, as their surroundings
were mild compared with the conditions that
the unique monoplane had been made to overcome.
And yet they were now beyond theorizing,
and it looked as if before the day was done
they were to prove the merits or weaknesses of
their much-lauded craft.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of one thing,&#8221; suggested Roy, a
little later; &#8220;we&#8217;re going to have daylight all
the way back.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; answered Norman, but not very
confidently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to be there by seven o&#8217;clock!&#8221;
retorted Roy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Norman in turn,
&#8220;but I&#8217;ve seen snow in the daytime so heavy
that it might as well have been night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, as long as we don&#8217;t lose the river,&#8221;
suggested Roy, &#8220;we can&#8217;t go far wrong. And
the compass ought to help some.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A compass is all right to keep you in a
general direction,&#8221; answered Norman, &#8220;but
the best of them, in a three hundred mile run,
won&#8217;t land you at any particular street
number.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; suggested Roy again, a little later,
&#8220;that we might as well put up these shelters
and have something to eat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>By this time the wind had died somewhat
and the volume of the snow had increased. It
was falling so heavily that the top of the car
was white. Norman&#8217;s silence giving approval,
Roy managed to elevate the protecting sections,
which in turn immediately began to be plastered
with soft flakes. Almost at once part of the section
on the lee side, which by good chance happened
to be the one next to the river, was lowered again
that the pilot might get a clear view.
Then Roy opened Philip&#8217;s bag of food.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>

<span class='caption'>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t shoot,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;What&#8217;s the use?&#8221;
<br />
</span>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></div>
<p>The aviators had both tea and water, but
they drank only the latter and made no attempt
to use the heating apparatus.
</p>
<p>At four o&#8217;clock the increasing snowfall was
beginning to give the machine some trouble,
and yet it was plowing its way steadily through
the air and neither boy was more than apprehensive.
Soon after this the snow ceased suddenly
and the wind rose as quickly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re losing some of our extra cargo anyway,&#8221;
announced Roy, as the first gusts tore
some of the accumulated snow from the
weighted planes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;re losing some considerable gas,&#8221;
added Norman. &#8220;I hope we don&#8217;t have to buck
this wind very long&mdash;it&#8217;s coming dead ahead.&#8221;
It was just then, the gloom merging into dark,
that the alert Roy exclaimed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look; a bunch o&#8217; deer!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The car was crossing the snow-flecked river
and flying low. Norman raised himself and
made out, in the edge of the timber below them,
a group of deer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t shoot,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;What&#8217;s the
use?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>But his admonition was too late. Roy&#8217;s
twenty-two had already sounded. However,
nothing but a bullet was lost. When the monoplane
had passed swiftly on its way, the placid
and apparently unmoved animals stood gazing
after the airship.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>IN THE LAND OF CARIBOU, MOOSE AND MUSK OX</h3>
</div>

<p>Within another hour, the first storm of the
season had turned into a blizzard. With the
provisions they had on hand the boys would
have made a landing to get what protection
they might from the blinding snow and the now-piercing
wind had they dared. They had not
yet changed the landing wheels of the monoplane
for their novel snow runners and they
realized that a new start in the rapidly increasing
snow was practically hopeless.
</p>
<p>Working directly ahead into the gale had so
reduced their speed that Norman had adopted
a series of long tacks. He did this in spite of
the fact that for miles at a time it took him from
the river valley, which he was now locating
mainly by the wind eddies he had learned to
know. There was no use turning on the searchlight,
as it merely gave them a little longer
view into the deep gray emptiness before them.
</p>
<p>Thoroughly appreciating their danger, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
boys also recognized that a panic of fear would
not help them. If the car should become
unmanageable, they would make the best landing
they could and, half burying the monoplane
in the snow, would await in the protected cockpit
the breaking of the blizzard and a new day.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway,&#8221; announced Roy at one time,
&#8220;while I ain&#8217;t exactly stuck on being here and
it ain&#8217;t as cheerful as I thought it would be, you
got to say this, the <i>Gitchie Manitou</i> ain&#8217;t falling
down any.&#8221;
</p>
<p>No attention was given to supper and it did
not get so cold but that the heavy clothing and
enclosed cockpit&mdash;for they had long since been
forced to put up all the sections&mdash;were ample
protection for the young men. Seven o&#8217;clock,
by which time they had expected to be in camp,
came, as did eight and nine. It was now long
after dark and, while the storm had abated
somewhat, there was still a heavy wind and
plenty of snow.
</p>
<p>For hours the boys had been simply following
the compass. They had not caught the roar of
the Grand Rapids and felt themselves practically
lost. By their calculation, and allowing
for a head wind, they had concluded that they
would have covered the three hundred miles by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
ten o&#8217;clock. If at that time they could make out
no signal light, they had decided to come down
on the upland and go into camp for the night.
</p>
<p>Their calculation was purely a guess but it
was not a bad one. Some time after half past
nine both boys made out in the far eastern sky
a soft glow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it had to be a clear night for the
Aurora Borealis,&#8221; suggested Roy, conscious
that his companion had also seen the same glow.
For a time Norman made no response but he
headed the machine directly toward the peculiar
flare and ceased his tacking.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no Aurora,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;I
think the woods are on fire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For ten minutes, through the thinning wind-tossed
snowflakes, the <i>Gitchie Manitou</i> groaned
its way forward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if it ain&#8217;t a big signal fire for us,&#8221;
suggested Roy at last.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a big blaze of some kind,&#8221; answered
Norman.
</p>
<p>Through the obscuring snow, the nervous
aviators had located the light many miles in
the distance. Now it began to rise up so suddenly
before them that they knew it had not
been very far away. Yet they could not make
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
up their mind that it was a signal fire. It did
not at all resemble a blaze of that kind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t run into it, whatever it is,&#8221;
shouted Roy a few minutes later as a tall spire-like
shaft of yellow light seemed almost to
block their progress.
</p>
<p>But Norman was already banking the machine,
and the flying car responded while the
wonder-struck boys gazed open-mouthed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the camp,&#8221; Norman yelled just then
as a little group of shadowy buildings seemed
to rise up out of the snow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve struck gas!&#8221; blurted Roy, as he
sprang to his feet. &#8220;The men have struck gas
and it&#8217;s a gusher!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Even as he yelled these words, the aviators
heard a quick fusilade of shots and as the car
darted onward were just able to catch sight of
shadowy forms running about within the glare
of the burning gas well. The sight was enough
of a shock to Norman to throw him off his guard
and the snow-weighted car careened wildly
toward the earth. Roy attempted to spring to
his companion&#8217;s assistance and realized almost
too late that this would be fatal. While the
perspiration sprang to Roy&#8217;s chilled face, Norman&#8217;s
presence of mind returned and he threw
the car upward and into equilibrium again.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>Then, straining every nerve, he made a wide
detour but while his brain acted, the muscles of
his hands and arms seemed suddenly paralyzed.
The car dropped slowly and safely in the midst
of the clearing, and when it touched the snow
the landing chassis caught and the airship
stopped as if in collision with a wall. Both boys
lunged forward and when Roy got to his feet
he found Norman curled up among the steering
apparatus, cold and motionless.
</p>
<p>It was a good half hour later when the young
aviator had been revived. His first inquiry was
about the <i>Gitchie Manitou</i>. When he learned
that this was apparently little injured and had
already been backed into the aerodrome, he
gave more evidence of his all-day&#8217;s strain by
again relapsing into unconsciousness on the cot
that had been improvised for him before the fire
in the living room.
</p>
<p>The more fortunate Roy was able to relate
their adventures and hear the details of the
gas gusher&#8217;s discovery that night. Within the
protected clearing, the storm had been more
of a heavy downfall of snow and less of a blizzard.
Anxious to move the derrick before winter
was fully upon them, Colonel Howell and
his two men had persisted in working the drill
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
all day. When the gas vein was unexpectedly
tapped late in the afternoon, the drill pipes had
been blown out and the escaping gas, igniting
from the near-by boiler, had consumed the derrick.
Fortunately, the tubing and drills had
been forced through the derrick and were saved.
</p>
<p>The engine house had also caught fire, but
this had been pulled down and it was thought
that the engine and boiler were undamaged.
These details were discussed while Roy ate a
late supper and drank with more relish than
ever before his tin of black tea. Norman was
so improved by morning that he was early astir,
eager for a view of the still roaring volume of
gas. He found that Colonel Howell had also
taken advantage of the first daylight to inventory
the possible damage.
</p>
<p>While the twisting yellow flame of the
uncapped well was less inspiring as day broke,
the roar of the escaping flame fascinated the
young aviator.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a gusher, and a dandy,&#8221; explained
Colonel Howell as he and Norman stood close
by it in the melting snow. &#8220;But I think we&#8217;re
prepared for it and we&#8217;ll try to cap it to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>All else, the clearing, the camp structures
and the banks of the river, were peaceful and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
white under the untracked mantle of new-fallen
snow. The wind had died out and the gas
camp at Fort McMurray stood on the verge of
the almost Arctic winter.
</p>
<p>The excitement attendant upon the wonderful
discovery and the attempt made at once to control
the fiery shaft again interfered with Colonel
Howell&#8217;s real plans of active prospecting.
For days the experienced oil men made futile
efforts to extinguish the gusher and to cap the
shaft. When they were of no assistance in this
work, Norman and Roy overhauled the airship
and substituted the ski-like runners in place
of the aluminum-cased rubber-tired landing
wheels.
</p>
<p>It seemed as if every trader, trapper and
prospector within fifty miles visited the camp.
A week after the discovery, somewhat to the
surprise of all, although apparently not so
much to Ewen and Miller, the long missing
Chandler appeared at the clearing late one
evening. If he had any apology to make to
Colonel Howell, the boys did not hear it. But
he was sober enough this time and somewhat
emaciated. He had come to settle with his old
employer and explained his long delay in doing
this by saying: &#8220;I knew my money was good
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
any time,&#8221; and that he had been trapping
farther down the river.
</p>
<p>He lounged about the camp the greater part
of the day and even volunteered his services in
the still unsuccessful attack of the flaming gas.
But Colonel Howell seemed without any interest
in his offers. The man was invited, however,
to eat in the camp and spend the night there.
</p>
<p>When the boys retired, Colonel Howell, the
visitor, and Ewen and Miller were still smoking
before the big fire. The next morning the boys
slept late and when they responded to Philip&#8217;s
persistent call to breakfast, they found that
Chandler had eaten and gone. Colonel Howell
was awaiting the boys, Ewen and Miller being
already at work on the blazing well, and he
seemed to have something on his mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would there be any great danger,&#8221; he
began at once, addressing Norman, &#8220;in making
a short flight in your airship in weather like
this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t bad,&#8221; volunteered Roy. &#8220;It&#8217;s
only a few degrees below zero. There&#8217;s a good
fall of snow for our runners and there hasn&#8217;t
been any wind since the blizzard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; resumed Colonel Howell, almost
meditatively, &#8220;it seems a shame for us to be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
livin&#8217; here in what you might call luxury and
folks starving all around us. Look at this,&#8221; he
went on, and he led the three boys near one of
the windows where a large Department of the
Interior map of northern Alberta was tacked
to the wall. &#8220;Here&#8217;s Fort McMurray and our
camp,&#8221; he began, pointing to a black spot on the
almost uncharted white, where the McMurray
River emptied into the Athabasca. Then he ran
his finger northward along the wide blue line
indicating the tortuous course of the Athabasca
past Fort McKay and the Indian settlement
described as Pierre au Calumet (marked
&#8220;abandoned&#8221;), past the Muskeg, the Firebag
and the Moose Rivers where they found their
way into the giant Athabasca between innumerable
black spots designated as &#8220;tar&#8221; islands,
and at last stopped suddenly at the words
&#8220;Pointe aux Tremble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s an Indian town,&#8221; went on Colonel
Howell, &#8220;and it&#8217;s about as far south as you
ever find the Chipewyans. It isn&#8217;t much over
a hundred miles from here and Chandler says
there ain&#8217;t a man left in the village. Pretty
soon, he thinks, there&#8217;ll be no women and children
left. Maybe he&#8217;s making a pretty black
picture but he says all the men have gone over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
toward the lake hunting. They&#8217;ve been gone
over two weeks and the camp was starving when
they left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The colonel, with a peculiar look on his face,
led the way back to the breakfast table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;These Indians are nothing to me,&#8221; he went
on at last, &#8220;and all Indians are starving pretty
much all the time, but they die just the same.
But somehow, with plenty of pork and flour here
and this great invention here right at hand from
which nobody&#8217;s benefitting, it seems to me we
must be pretty hard-hearted to sit in comfort,
stuffing ourselves, while little babies are dying
for scraps that we&#8217;re throwing in the river.
I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel,&#8221; exclaimed Roy at once, &#8220;you&#8217;ve
said enough. Get up what you can spare and
we&#8217;ll have bannocks baking in that settlement
before noon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to get you into another blizzard,&#8221;
began the colonel, yet his satisfaction
was apparent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry about that,&#8221; broke in
Norman. &#8220;I think we feel a good deal the
same way about this. Besides, aren&#8217;t we
working for you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing like that!&#8221; expostulated the oil
prospector. &#8220;This isn&#8217;t an order.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help get the stuff ready,&#8221; began Paul,
&#8220;for I know that&#8217;s all I can do. Is this Chandler
trapping near there?&#8221; he went on, as he
gulped down the last of his tea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Says he&#8217;s been helping them,&#8221; explained
Colonel Howell, &#8220;but he couldn&#8217;t have done
much, judging by his appearance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he going back there?&#8221; asked Roy
curiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t say,&#8221; answered Colonel Howell
slowly. &#8220;But he&#8217;s got his money now and
I imagine he won&#8217;t go much farther than Fort
McMurray. I don&#8217;t care for him and I don&#8217;t
like him around the camp. He&#8217;s too busy talking
when the men ought to be at work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was an ideal winter&#8217;s day, the atmosphere
clear and the temperature just below zero.
There was no cause for delay and while Norman
made a tracing and a scale of the route, Paul
and Roy drew the <i>Gitchie Manitou</i> into the open.
Colonel Howell and the half-breed cook had
been busy in the storehouse, arranging packets
of flour and cutting up sides of fat pork. Small
packages of tea were also prepared, together
with sugar, salt and half a case of evaporated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
fruit. The only bread on hand was the remainder
of Philip&#8217;s last baking of bannock.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See how things are,&#8221; suggested Colonel
Howell, when these articles were passed up to
Roy, &#8220;and if they&#8217;re as bad as Chandler says,
we&#8217;ll have to send Philip out for a moose.
These things&#8217;ll carry &#8217;em along for a few days
at least.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The look on the young Count&#8217;s face was such
that Norman was disturbed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Paul, old man,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I know you&#8217;d
like to go with us and we&#8217;d like to have you.
But we&#8217;ve got more than the weight of a third
man in all this food. I hope you don&#8217;t feel
disappointed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I do, in a way,&#8221; answered Paul, with
a feeble attempt at a smile, &#8220;but it isn&#8217;t just
from curiosity. I envy you fellows. You&#8217;re
always helping and I never find anything
to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can help me to-day,&#8221; laughed Colonel
Howell. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to cap that gas well or
bust it open in a new place. I&#8217;ll give you a job
that may make both of us sit up and take
notice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; exclaimed Paul, seeming
instantly to forget the mission of the machine.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been wanting a finger in that pie from the
start.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good luck to you,&#8221; called out Norman, as
he sprang aboard the monoplane, and the colonel
caught Paul laughingly by the arm and held
him while Norman threw the big propeller into
sizzling revolution.
</p>
<p>The powerful car slid forward for the first
time on its wooden snowshoes. As it caught
the impulse of the great propeller, it sprang
into the air and then dropped to the snow again
with the wiggling motion of an inexperienced
skater. Then, suddenly responding again to the
propeller, it darted diagonally toward a menacing
tree stump; but Norman was too quick for
it. Before harm could result, the planes lifted
and the airship, again in its native element,
hurled itself skyward steadily and true.
</p>
<p>It was an exhilarating flight. For the first
time the boys got a bird&#8217;s-eye view of Fort
McMurray and were surprised to find that the
main settlement drifted down to the river in a
long-drawn-out group of cabins. Few people
were in sight, however, and all the world spread
out beneath them as if frozen into silence. The
big river continued its course between the same
high hills and, as the last cabin disappeared,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
the boys headed the <i>Gitchie Manitou</i> directly
for the top of the hills, where the plains began
that led onward and onward until the sparse
forests finally disappeared in the broken land
of the Barren Grounds. And on these, not
much farther to the North, they knew that caribou
and moose roamed in herds of thousands,
and that the musk ox, the king of the Northland
big game, made his Arctic home.

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>IN THE CABIN OF THE PARALYZED INDIAN</h3>
</div>

<p>No sooner had the monoplane begun to disappear
over the northern hills than the impatient
Paul demanded the attention of Colonel Howell.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel,&#8221; he began, &#8220;I&#8217;m almost ashamed
to even make the suggestion, but I&#8217;ve been
watching the men at work on the gusher. They
don&#8217;t seem able to get a plug into the pipe or to
put a cap on the end of it, even with the rigging
they&#8217;ve managed to set up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We seem to be at the end of our string,&#8221;
laughed Colonel Howell. &#8220;But laymen frequently
make suggestions that never occur to
professionals. Have you an idea?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much of a one,&#8221; answered Paul diffidently,
&#8220;but I learned one thing in school&mdash;I
think it was in what you call &#8216;Physics.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Speak out,&#8221; laughed Colonel Howell.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve utilized all our own ideas; that is, all
but one, and I don&#8217;t like that. I suppose we can
dig a pit around the pipe and smother the blaze.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
But that&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be quite a job, and I&#8217;m not
sure it would work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A pit!&#8221; exclaimed Paul. &#8220;Now I&#8217;ve got
it. They used to tell me, when you strike a
force you can&#8217;t handle, try to break it up into
parts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colonel Howell looked up quickly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t need a pit,&#8221; went on Paul, &#8220;but
something like a trench. Let&#8217;s dig down alongside
the pipe until we&#8217;re ten or fifteen feet
beneath the ground and then tap the tube and
let some of the gas out where it won&#8217;t do any
harm. If we can&#8217;t drill a hole, we can rig up a
long-handled chisel and punch an opening.
When the gas rushes out, down there in the
trench, maybe it won&#8217;t catch fire for a few
minutes and it&#8217;s sure to shut off a good deal
of the pressure at the mouth of the tube. If it
does, maybe we can get the cap and the regulator
on the top. Then we can plug the opening
below. It&#8217;ll leak, of course, but the regulator&#8217;ll
fix things so we can use the gas at least.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colonel Howell thought a moment and then
slapped the young man on the back. Without a
word, he hurried to the two workmen and in a
few moments Ewen and Miller had begun digging
into the frozen ground. Colonel Howell&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
orders were for them to make a trench about
four feet wide and extending toward the river
about twenty feet. It was to be twenty feet
deep alongside the pipe and in the form of a triangle,
the long side to incline toward the river.
This was to facilitate the removal of the gravel
and dirt and to afford a path to the deep side
of the trench where it touched the gas tubing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Five feet from the bottom,&#8221; explained the
enthusiastic Paul, &#8220;we&#8217;ll put a shelf across
the trench and we&#8217;ll work from this, so that
when a hole is made in the pipe no one will be
in danger from the rush of gas.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; added Colonel Howell.
&#8220;All the gas can&#8217;t get out through the new
opening, but enough of it ought to escape to
make it possible to work on the top opening.
But we&#8217;ll hardly finish the ditch before the
boys get back?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; smiled the happy Paul. &#8220;They
ought to be here before dark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>While Ewen and Miller were busy with picks
and shovels, Colonel Howell and Paul devoted
themselves to improvising the long wooden
handle for the chisel to be used in cutting the
pipe. But the workmen had not finished the
trench when night came and, to the surprise of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
Colonel Howell and Paul, the <i>Gitchie Manitou</i>
had not returned. This fact especially disturbed
Colonel Howell and Paul because soon
after noon the bright day had ended and the
afternoon had passed with lowering clouds and
other evidences, including a decided drop in the
temperature, that a bad night was approaching.
</p>
<p>The northward flight of the aviators had been
made without any premonition of this change.
After the monoplane had reached the high
ground, Norman could not resist a temptation
to make his way some miles back from the river,
where the boys could see that the sparse timber
grew very much thinner and that within five
miles of the river the timberland disappeared
altogether in a wide prairie or plain. Still
farther to the east, they could make out irregular
elevations on the plain, which appeared
to be treeless ridges.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish we had time to go over there,&#8221;
remarked Roy, &#8220;for we may never get back
this way and I&#8217;d like to have had one good look
at the caribou lands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the general nature of this treeless, barren
waste had been ascertained and Norman
brought the swift car back on its flight toward
the river. Colonel Howell had explained to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
them that the Indian village they were seeking
was one hundred miles from the gas camp. As
it was not certain that Pointe aux Tremble
could be easily made out from a distance, it
was necessary to keep careful watch of the
chronometer and the propeller revolution
gauge.
</p>
<p>The flight over the picturesque banks of the
great river was now getting to be an old story
to the boys and protected as they were in the
inclosed cockpit, the journey proceeded with
only occasional comment. They had left the
camp at nine twenty-five o&#8217;clock, having set the
engines at fifty miles, and, allowing for their
detour, at a quarter after eleven o&#8217;clock Roy
arose and began to use his binoculars. But
either the reputed distance or the boys&#8217; calculations
were wrong, for it was not until a quarter
of twelve o&#8217;clock that they caught sight of
a few cabins scattered along the riverbank
within a fringe of poplar trees.
</p>
<p>It was necessary to find a suitable landing
place and both aviators busied themselves in
this respect with no great result. What clearing
there was seemed to be full of tree stumps
and large brush. The car, having passed over
the few cabins of what seemed to be a deserted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
village, with no living thing in sight, it was
necessary to make a turn to look for a landing
place in the vicinity. In doing this, Norman
made a wide swing.
</p>
<p>The only naturally open place was some distance
to the east. Without consulting Roy, he
made for this white glare of snow. As the
monoplane dropped toward the wide opening,
Roy made a desperate dive toward the floor of
the cockpit and, before Norman learned the
situation, his chum was pulling its new mooseskin
jacket from the .303 rifle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a moose!&#8221; shouted Roy, &#8220;and a
dandy. Gi&#8217; me a shot at it. I&#8217;ve got to shoot
something from the machine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought there wasn&#8217;t any game around
here,&#8221; answered Norman, trying in vain to get
his eyes above the cockpit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess the hunters have all gone too far,&#8221;
answered Roy breathlessly. &#8220;Anyway, there&#8217;s
a dandy bull right out there in the open. Give
me a shot at it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As he spoke, he dropped one of the front
sections and pointed to one side of the basin-like
opening among the spruce trees. The
moment Norman caught sight of the animal,
which stood with its forefeet together, its head
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
erect, and its immense spread of antlers reared
almost defiantly, he brought the machine
directly toward the animal. There was a heavy
discharge from Roy&#8217;s rifle, but no sign that his
shot had gone home.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Try him again,&#8221; laughed Norman. &#8220;He&#8217;s
big as a barn.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But while Roy pumped a new shell into
place, the erect animal suddenly stumbled and
then with a snort whirled and sprang toward
the trees. This time when the rifle sounded the
great antlers seemed to rise higher and then the
moose lunged forward on its head and began
kicking in the snow. Norman, gazing at the
struggling animal, brought the monoplane to
the wide drifts of snow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You get out and finish him,&#8221; he exclaimed
as the <i>Gitchie Manitou</i> came to a jolting stop.
&#8220;It&#8217;s getting colder. I&#8217;m going to put some
alcohol an&#8217; glycerine in the radiator. This isn&#8217;t
a very good place to freeze up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not wait till we get over to the
camp?&#8221; asked Roy as he dropped one of the
side sections.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got enough of a load now,&#8221; answered
Norman as he began to prowl around
among the extra supplies. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t much
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
snow among the trees. We&#8217;ll take all we can
carry of this fresh meat and go to the camp
on foot. There&#8217;s no place to land there,
anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Closing the machine, the two boys soon
quartered the moose, and leaving a part of the
carcass in the lower limbs of a spruce tree,
shouldered the remainder and made their way
toward the Indian village. The snow and their
heavy load made this a panting task and in
the mile walk they paused to rest several times.
</p>
<p>When they finally reached the edge of the
Indian settlement and broke their way through
the last of the trees, they found before them a
picture that had escaped them from the airship.
In the distance lay the deserted looking cabins
but, nearer by and as if seeking protection
among the scrub spruce, rose a single tepee.
Before it stood two men and two squaws.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They must have seen us,&#8221; panted Roy, as
he and Norman advanced, bending low under
their burdens. &#8220;They seem to be watchin&#8217; for
us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In fact, one of the men had his arms outstretched.
The cheerless group was made even
more so by a small, almost blazeless fire, in the
thin smoke of which was suspended a black
kettle.
</p>

&#8220;They must have seen us,&#8221; panted Roy as he and Norman advanced.
<br />
</span>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No wonder they let a moose almost stick
his nose in camp,&#8221; was Norman&#8217;s comment.
&#8220;The men seem to be as old as Methuselah.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was nothing dramatic in the arrival of
the boys, for the Indians spoke no English
and gave not the least sign of gratitude when
the quarters of the moose were thrown on the
ground. Both the women sank on their knees
and one of them eagerly bit into the raw flesh.
After vainly attempting to talk to the men, Norman
pointed to a knife in the belt of one of them
and then at the freezing flesh on the ground.
</p>
<p>While the boys watched them, this aged and
emaciated Chipewyan also dropped on his knees
and hastily cut off four strips of flesh. Without
any attempt at cooking these the starving group
attacked them voraciously in their raw condition.
After a few moments, the boys took the
other quarter and, motioning toward the other
cabins, started toward them. They decided, if
they found no younger men, to take the two old
men back to the monoplane and deliver to them
their other provisions.
</p>
<p>Having reached the first cabin, the boys at
once discovered that Chandler had not overstated
the camp condition. Neither in this
filthy structure, nor in any but one of the other
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
half dozen did they find anyone but women and
children. In each cabin there was heat in
plenty, but signs of food were wholly missing.
In each place the air was foul, and half-clad
children made the situation pitiable. In one
fortunate cabin, the children were chewing
shreds of skin.
</p>
<p>Still unable to find anyone who could speak
English, the boys continued their work of
rescue by cutting off a generous piece of moose
and then continuing their investigation. Having
reached the last cabin, which differed in no
respect from the others, Norman and Roy came
across a surprise that was a shock to them.
Swinging open the door, without warning, they
entered a chill interior that was reeking with
new odors. A small fire burned in one corner
and before it, on a pallet of worn and greasy
blankets, lay the distorted figure of a man. He
was the sole occupant of the almost dark room.
</p>
<p>While the boys hesitated, choking with the
rancid and stifling odors about them, they saw
the figure turn its head with an effort. Then
they saw that it was a man of about middle age,
who was almost completely paralyzed. He could
move neither his legs nor his body, but with the
use of his elbows, he was just able to turn the
upper part of his body.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>He did not resent the intrusion but he did
not give the young men the least sign of welcome.
In his left hand rested a charred stick.
With this he was able to reach the little fire at
his side, in front of which was piled a heap of
small sticks and branches&mdash;his firewood.
</p>
<p>The fireplace and chimney, which was also
inside the cabin, were made of clay and occupied
the corner of the uninviting apartment.
Near the fire stood a smoke-begrimed frying
pan in which there was a piece of black meat of
some kind. On the dirty clay hearth was a tin
basin, in which were a few ounces of soiled
looking meal or flour.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The man&#8217;s paralyzed,&#8221; remarked Norman
in an undertone. &#8220;But at that he seems better
off than the rest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t starvin&#8217;, at least,&#8221; answered Roy.
&#8220;But we&#8217;d better give him his share of moose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He spoke to the man and was surprised to
receive a grin in return. It meant that the
invalid did not understand. But the moment
they offered the meat to the almost-helpless
man, they were glad to see that he had the full
use of his arms and fingers. Reaching for a
knife that lay under him, he began to cut off
pieces of fat with celerity. These he ate without
cooking.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>The close cabin was so crowded with articles
of various kinds that the boys could not resist
an examination before they took their leave.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody&#8217;s been livin&#8217; here besides this
man,&#8221; exclaimed Roy at once. He pointed to the
opposite corner of the cabin where there were
indications that some one had had a bunk.
Then in the other end of the room they found
the cause of the heavy odors. Hanging from
the rafters were several dozen skins, stretched
tightly on trappers&#8217; boards, and in various
states of curing. There was also a collection
of steel traps, a dog sled and a jumbled mass
of dog harness.
</p>
<p>Curing skins was not exactly a novelty to
either of the boys but they knew a valuable
skin from an ordinary one and they could not
resist the temptation to look for a possible
silver fox. They soon decided that the trapper
who might have collected these furs was one
of no great experience. Roy pointed to the
skins, then made signs to the Indian as if to
ask if the skins belonged to him. The man
grinned in silence and punched up his little fire.
Roy was examining one of the stretched hides
when he suddenly called to Norman and pointed
to a name written with indelible pencil near
the bottom of the board.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what do you think of that?&#8221; exclaimed
the astonished Norman.
</p>
<p>The two boys were looking at the scrawl
which was plainly &#8220;E. O. Chandler.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There you are!&#8221; exclaimed Roy. &#8220;Here&#8217;s
where our friend made his headquarters. No
wonder he knew that the Indians were
starving.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a light tapping on the floor and
the paralyzed and speechless Indian pointed
toward the corner of the room where there
were signs of a bunk. In the gloom the boys
went to this place. But they noticed nothing
in particular until the prostrate Indian again
lifted his stick upward. And then, shoved in a
crevice between the logs, they saw a soiled and
crumpled envelope. Taking it to the window,
they read plainly enough the address&mdash;&#8220;E. O.
Chandler, Fort McMurray.&#8221; There was no
postmark but in the upper left hand corner was
this printing&mdash;&#8220;Hill Howell, Contractor, Centralia,
Kansas.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one of the envelopes that Colonel Howell
has down in camp,&#8221; exclaimed Roy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Norman slowly, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll
bet you it&#8217;s a message that either Ewen or
Miller wrote to Chandler after he left us.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think we ought to read it?&#8221; asked
Roy, his fingers grasping the greasy envelope
as if itching to extract the enclosure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon it&#8217;s none of our business,&#8221; answered
Norman, as if with some regret, &#8220;but
I&#8217;ll bet it concerns Colonel Howell and I believe
we ought to take it to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Roy turned toward the Indian and made signs
of putting the letter in his pocket. If this meant
anything to the helpless man, he gave no sign
other than the same peculiar grin. Roy put the
envelope in his pocket and, making signs of
farewell, the two boys left the cabin.

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>A LETTER GOES WRONG</h3>
</div>

<p>The conditions that the young aviators had
just encountered had not sharpened their appetites.
But again in the fresh air, they decided
to use speed and complete their mission and,
incidentally, to have a little tea and some bannock
at the airship.
</p>
<p>At two of the cabins where they had seen
the strongest women, they stopped and made
signs for the squaws to follow them. At the
tepee in the edge of the woods they found the
two old men and the two women huddled around
a fire on the inside of the tepee, with every sign
of having gorged themselves upon the food
given them. In the kettle outside, chunks of
the moose were stewing under a now brisk fire.
This entire party was also enlisted and Norman
and Roy made their way back to the snow
basin in the woods. Without delay they passed
out all the supplies to the Indians who had
accompanied them, showed them the remainder
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
of the moose and made signs that these should
be distributed equally among all. With every
expression of pleasure, but none of gratitude,
the six Indians took instant departure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s three o&#8217;clock,&#8221; announced Norman,
when this had been done. &#8220;Now for a little
camp fire out here in the snow, some tea and a
piece of bannock, and we&#8217;ll make a record trip
back home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Unaware of the disastrous discovery they
were soon to make the two boys took a leisurely
rest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only time I miss a pipe,&#8221; remarked
Roy as he sat behind a snow bank with his feet
toward the cheery blaze.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if ever I begin,&#8221; said Norman in
turn, &#8220;I&#8217;ll never try to manipulate any of this
plug smokin&#8217; stuff. I&#8217;ll go to the States for a
mixture of some kind and not try to shave down
the brick of hydraulic-pressed tobacco that the
half-breeds use.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After a long loaf before the fire the boys
made preparations to return.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks a little like the blizzard day,&#8221; remarked
Roy, &#8220;and it&#8217;s certainly getting some
colder. I hope the wind won&#8217;t come up. If it
does, I hope it comes out of the north.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>While he spoke, the two boys took hold of
the frame of the monoplane to pull it out onto
the smooth snow and head it south. The airship
had been resting upon what seemed to be a little
ridge. Pulling the chassis from this rise in
the snow, they were both astounded to find the
body of the car shift to one side and sink into
the snow.
</p>
<p>Both sprang to that side of the car and Norman,
running his hand along the wooden landing
ski, gasped with astonishment when he
found the long runner broken sharply in the
middle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;This runner&#8217;s
out of business!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Roy ran to the rear where the car had stopped
and found underneath the snow a rocky ledge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She hit this!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Can&#8217;t we
tie her up?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Norman was plainly in doubt but they cleared
away the surrounding snow and found that,
instead of a single break, a section of the runner
had been shattered. Two jagged ends of wood
extended into the soft snow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll find any way to fix them,&#8221; exclaimed
Norman, &#8220;maybe we can get a start.
But it looks to me as if we&#8217;d have to make a
new runner.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; exclaimed Roy, beating his
numbing hands together. &#8220;We can fix &#8217;er.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The two boys made this attempt and, as often
as they thought they had patched up the shattered
ski and mounted into the car in attempts
to make a start, the patched strip of wood would
part and the chassis would lunge again into the
snow.
</p>
<p>After a half hour of attempts of this kind,
Roy recalled the dog sled in the distant hut of
the paralyzed Indian and, in desperation, after
four o&#8217;clock, for it was now getting desperately
cold, he secured Norman&#8217;s consent to a trip back
to the Indian&#8217;s cabin and the securing of at
least a part of the sled to patch up their
machine.
</p>
<p>The winter days were now growing short and
when Roy hurried away into the gray woods
night was fast coming on. Nor did he find an
easy task before him. In the end it was necessary
to pay the paralytic twenty-five dollars
before he could secure possession of the sled.
As he made his way back to his waiting companion,
he had to stick to the trails that they
had previously made, for in the woods darkness
had already come.
</p>
<p>At the airship camp he found Norman had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
put in his waiting time in collecting a pile of
fallen timber. It was now so cold that this
served a double purpose&mdash;they needed the
warmth and it served to illuminate the vicinity.
</p>
<p>The benumbed Roy also found tea ready and,
better yet, a generous piece of moose meat frying
in the edge of the fire. These, with some
broken bannock heated in the fat of the meat,
gave the boys a welcome supper. Then, piling
new wood on the fire, they began again the
task of repairing the chassis. Here they were
handicapped by the darkness, as they were
afraid to get the monoplane and its reservoirs
of gasoline too near the blazing camp fire.
</p>
<p>Finally they solved this difficulty by starting
the engine and using one of their adjustable
light bulbs, which they hung over the side of the
car. Yet the cold had become so intense,
although it was a dry Arctic cold, that the work
went forward only by stages, the boys being
forced to stop and warm their hands from time
to time at the camp fire.
</p>
<p>When the new moon showed through the dark
border of spruce trees and the brilliant northern
stars pierced the black sky, the young aviators
were ready for another trial. It was eight
o&#8217;clock. This time they packed the snow for a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
hundred yards in front of the chassis of the car,
and then, arranging their few blankets in the
cockpit and refreshing themselves with some
newly-made hot tea, exhausted and nervous,
they climbed aboard. Putting on all their power
and holding their runners steadily to the packed
snow, they again started the <i>Gitchie Manitou</i>.
</p>
<p>While the runners were yet gliding over the
evenly-packed snow drifts, there came an ominous
jar on the side of the repaired ski and
Norman instantly threw the planes upward. It
was a chance for, if the car settled again, the
new runner would probably give away. In its
gathering momentum, the airship drifted snowward
again while both boys gulped. Then as if
guiding itself, it sprang upward once more.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right!&#8221; shouted Roy, &#8220;but we
had a close call. If we have to come down
again we&#8217;ll never get up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When we land again,&#8221; added Norman, his
mouth dry, &#8220;it&#8217;ll be in the gas camp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a few minutes the airship was over the
Athabasca River again, which was now vaporless
and white beneath them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s cold, all right,&#8221; was Roy&#8217;s comment at
this moment. &#8220;I think there&#8217;s ice on the
river.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>In spite of the increasing coldness, the
<i>Gitchie Manitou</i> made its way without trouble
toward the distant camp. There was no wind
and, although the boys computed the temperature
outside at not less than twenty below zero,
the interior of the little cockpit soon became
cozy enough. The heating appliances had been
connected with the dynamo and Norman at
times even complained of the heat. After the
first hour of flight, both boys began looking
for the flare of the gas well. When this at
last came in sight, the car was headed directly
for it. At that time both boys agreed that the
river beneath was covered with ice from shore
to shore.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway,&#8221; said Norman, as the gas well
came into full view, &#8220;looks as if Paul didn&#8217;t
succeed in capping the gusher to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>To warn their friends of their arrival, the
boys threw on their searchlight, and the arrival
back of the aerodrome was unmarked, except by
the vociferous welcome accorded by the alarmed
occupants of the camp.
</p>
<p>Another supper was awaiting the relief
expedition and for some time all were busy with
the cause of the delay and the details of the
condition of the Indian encampment. Unquestionably
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
there would have to be another visit to
the camp to ascertain at least the result of the
hunting expedition.
</p>
<p>Strangely enough, before the matter of
Chandler&#8217;s letter was reached, the discussion
reached the work on the gas well that day.
When Roy suddenly recalled the episode of the
discovery in the paralyzed Indian&#8217;s cabin he
started to produce the letter, but hesitated
because both Ewen and Miller were present. In
his discussion with Norman on the way back,
it had been decided that the letter had probably
been written by one or the other of these men
and that its appearance might cause embarrassment.
Both Ewen and Miller had been very
curious about the settlement at Pointe aux
Tremble, but they had asked no questions that
connected Chandler with the place.
</p>
<p>When the hour grew late and Colonel Howell
proposed retiring to the bunk room where
the iron stove was red hot, since neither Ewen
nor Miller gave signs of turning in, Roy put off
the matter of the letter until later. When the
three boys sought their bunks, Ewen and Miller
still lingered in the big room, and Colonel
Howell was asleep.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Time enough in the morning,&#8221; suggested
Norman.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></p>
<p>In the morning, however, Colonel Howell
and Paul with Ewen and Miller were up and at
work before Norman and Roy were astir. The
weather had not moderated but Colonel Howell
was anxious to bring the work on the gusher
to a close. Ewen and Miller attacked the frost
hardened ground before breakfast and this
work had now reached the point where Paul
could help in removing the heavy clods.
</p>
<p>When the young aviators joined their friends
at breakfast, Ewen and Miller were present
again and the letter was not exhibited. Then
all hurried out to complete the work of attempting
to control the gusher. The regulator and
the ordinary apparatus to connect it with the
mouth of the pipe, together with the smaller
tubes and their valves that were to be attached
above the regulator, were all in place. In the
end, Colonel Howell proposed, with still smaller
pipes, to lead part of the gas into the fireplace
and the bunk house stove.
</p>
<p>At eleven o&#8217;clock the perspiring men in the
trench announced this part of the work completed.
Then it required only a few minutes
to brace a narrow platform about five feet above
the bottom of the trench, next to the tube, and
all paused for a short rest before making the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
final experiment. At last the men took their
places near the roaring gusher and, at Paul&#8217;s
request, he was given the opportunity to use
his well-muscled arms in swinging the sledge,
Colonel Howell taking his place on the platform
in charge of a long-handled chisel.
</p>
<p>The duties of Norman and Roy were to assist
the two workmen in manipulating the chain
pulley, by which the first tap was to be forced
on the open end of the pipe. This of course
was pierced with holes, so that the pressure
beneath it might not be altogether shut off.
This was to be forced down upon the steel drill
tube, after which the regulator was to be similarly
attached to the threads of the preliminary
cap. The situation was hazardous for all.
There was danger that the out-rushing gas in
the trench below might explode when it rose and
came in contact with the roaring blaze above.
But it was hoped that the work might be done
so quickly that this would not result.
</p>
<p>When Ewen had laid out his apparatus about
the mouth of the tube with all the care of a
surgeon preparing for a hasty operation, and
Paul and Colonel Howell had taken their position
on the scaffold far below, Ewen suddenly
shouted:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ready!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A heavy blow resounded in the narrow pit.
Then another, and another, and a new roar
broke out below. Dropping their tools, Colonel
Howell and Paul fled up their improvised
ladder and when they reached the surface they
saw the workmen and Norman and Roy, their
faces distorted with effort and their clothes
almost scorching, bend to the task before them.
The escaping gas was still roaring and the
flames were leaping sideways.
</p>
<p>Norman and Roy were almost flat on the
ground, hanging on to the pulley chain. The
first cap was in place and, with a long wrench,
Ewen was twisting it onto the thread. A new
volume of gas was already rolling from the
pit, while from the incline opposite the mouth
of the new opening, gravel and clods of earth
were shooting riverward like the sparks of a
Bessemer furnace. Paul threw himself on the
ground with the other boys and added his
strength to theirs in holding the cap in place.
All seemed to forget the possibility of a new
explosion.
</p>
<p>There was a hoarse shout from Ewen and
the boys released the pulley chain while Miller
slapped the regulator between the guide rods.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
As the three young men again threw themselves
upon the chain and forced the regulator into
place, the crucial moment had arrived. The controlling
valve of the regulator was open, of
course, and as the rushing gas was again concentrated
into one stream, a new fiery jet shot
upward. But the lateral streams had been controlled
and again Ewen applied the wrench to
thread the regulator to the first cap. Once he
failed and then the threads caught. With a yell
of victory the veteran gas man threw himself
against the long wrench again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got &#8217;er!&#8221; exclaimed Colonel
Howell as he sprang to Ewen&#8217;s side and joined
him in screwing the regulator into place. Even
before he spoke there was a renewed roar in the
trench beneath and a new volume of gas poured
upward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fill &#8217;er in!&#8221; shouted Paul. &#8220;The big rocks
first.&#8221; And then, while the newly confined gas
still shot upward through the regulator in a
screaming stream of fire, six pairs of hands,
including those of the energetic Philip, hurled
a collected heap of rocks to the bottom of the
trench and around the new opening.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to stop the flow,&#8221; explained
Colonel Howell to Norman and Roy, as all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
panted in their work, &#8220;but it&#8217;s Paul&#8217;s idea, and
I think he&#8217;s put it over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now for the dirt!&#8221; shouted Paul, who was
leading in the work. With shovels and pieces
of board, the excavated material was rapidly
dumped into the trench. With each new shovelful
of material, the escape of gas from the
trench became less and the roar from the open
regulator became more deafening. When at
last only an odor of gas escaped from the newly
packed trench, Paul exclaimed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty of water dumped in here ought to
make a solid cake of ice around the opening and
that ought to fix us till spring anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The cleverest idea you&#8217;ve yet given us!&#8221;
exclaimed Colonel Howell, as all paused for
breath. &#8220;Now, go over and finish your job.
Turn off the regulator.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Proudly enough, Paul sprang to the roaring
gusher and gave the protected valve wheel a
few quick turns. Instantly the flow was shut
off and silence followed. The young Austrian
had made good.
</p>
<p>Many other mechanical details had to be
seen to but the great problem had been solved
and all were elated. The main work accomplished,
Colonel Howell and the young men retired
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
to the cabin, where, as soon as the excitement
over Paul&#8217;s victory had somewhat subsided,
Roy produced the letter he had found in
the cabin of the paralyzed Indian. Colonel
Howell, having heard the explanation of the
finding of the letter, without any hesitation and
evidently without any qualms of conscience,
drew out the enclosure. The letter was an
illiterate scrawl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Chandler,&#8221; it began, &#8220;we have decided
our answer is this. Mebbe you are right
and we three have done all the work here, but
Colonel Howell has always been on the square.
If you think you are intitled to go to Edmonton
and make a claim for this property, we don&#8217;t.
It&#8217;s been a perty hard job, but we been paid for
it and don&#8217;t think we have no claim fur a title
to this claim. Besides, this ain&#8217;t no time to
try to go to Edmonton and get out papers. If
we was goin, we&#8217;d wait till the river froze and
take a dogsled. When you get your money you
can go if you like. Like we promised you, we
wont say nothin. So long as Colonel Howell
treats us square we&#8217;re goin to stick. So no
more at present.
</p>

</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></div>
<p>The message was dated August 10th and was
evidently a reply to some proposition made by
Chandler after he was kicked out of the camp.
While Colonel Howell read it, his face was very
sober. Then he read it aloud to the boys and
tossed it on the table while he lit a new cigar.
All sat in silence for some time and then Norman
said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess Chandler must have changed his
mind too. He was here yesterday morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the river&#8217;s frozen now,&#8221; suggested Roy
quickly. &#8220;What does this mean, Colonel
Howell?&#8221; went on Roy, his curiosity overcoming
him.
</p>
<p>The colonel took a long draw on his cigar and
at last found his old-time smile.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>ROY CONDUCTS A HUNT</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;At first,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it looked simple
enough. So far as this letter is concerned,
I&#8217;m not bothered. That is, I&#8217;m not afraid of
Ewen and Miller. But Chandler&#8217;s proposition
is another matter. It&#8217;s plain enough that he
wanted our men to join him and go to Edmonton
and file papers on this claim. But that isn&#8217;t
as ridiculous as it appears. You know,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;Mr. Zept asked me if I hadn&#8217;t grubstaked
these fellows. If they could make it
appear that I had, then part of this claim would
belong to them. And if they all got together
and swore that I had, I don&#8217;t know how I could
prove that they were working for me on wages.
Even if our own men would testify for me that
this was my claim, if Chandler should happen
to file his papers, this would cloud my title.
Besides,&#8221; went on the colonel, &#8220;Chandler is a
naturalized Canadian and you know the mining
laws up here are not made to favor the outsider.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
A foreigner such as I am, when he&#8217;s working in
these unsurveyed districts, can only stake out
his claim, wait for the survey and then buy the
property. Chandler would have it all over me
if he set up the claim of a native, especially
ahead of me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s gone,&#8221; suggested Paul,
&#8220;for he ate breakfast here yesterday morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s somewhere between two hundred
and fifty and three hundred miles between here
and the land office,&#8221; exclaimed Norman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be interesting to know whether he
has gone,&#8221; answered Colonel Howell.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not ask Miller or Ewen?&#8221; broke in
Roy. &#8220;They might know something about
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Colonel Howell shook his head: &#8220;They&#8217;d
better know nothing about the letter,&#8221; he answered
at last. &#8220;It was written a long time
ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean they may have changed their
minds?&#8221; asked Norman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean that,&#8221; answered Colonel
Howell, his face again sober, &#8220;but they had
the matter under consideration once. I don&#8217;t
suspect them. I&#8217;ll just keep my eyes open and
say nothing. If they are all right they might
get sore and leave me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mind,&#8221; asked Roy, &#8220;if I go out
and do a little investigating? Chandler may be
over to Fort McMurray.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The colonel thought a moment and then answered:
</p>
<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t do any harm. All of you might
go hunting this afternoon over in that direction&mdash;if
it isn&#8217;t too cold.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eagerly enough the boys accepted the suggestion.
Protected by their heavy clothing and
carrying the camera and their skin-protected
rifles, they found the trip to the settlement only
exhilarating. At Fort McMurray the temperature,
which was twenty-two below zero, did not
give much trouble so long as the wind did not
blow. To those whom they met, the boys talked
of being on their way to the hills for moose.
But later they determined not to venture upon
the highlands, deciding to make a detour in the
timber on their way back for a possible deer.
</p>
<p>They had no trouble in getting trace of
Chandler. In the cabin of a white prospector,
where Chandler was well known, they picked up
the latest town gossip. This was that Chandler,
who yet seemed to have plenty of money, had
hired Pete Fosseneuve, a half-breed, only two
days before to take him back to his trapping
camp at Pointe aux Tremble.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been working there all fall,&#8221; explained
their informant, &#8220;and Fosseneuve has a team
of six fine dogs. He paid Pete a lot of money
to take him back to his camp night before last.
They ought to be there to-morrow some time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This statement allayed the suspicion directed
against the dissolute Englishman and the young
men made an early return to the camp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t say anything to Ewen and
Miller,&#8221; commented Colonel Howell, when he
learned that Chandler had gone still further into
the woods. &#8220;Now we&#8217;ll get to work on our
prospecting in earnest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When the controlled gas had been piped into
the cabin, in spite of the cold weather, Ewen and
Miller at once went to work building a new derrick
near the best prospect and sledging the
boiler and engine to that location. In this work
nearly a week went by, the boys finding little to
do. The weather seemed settled into a cold
spell in which the thermometer ranged at noonday
about twenty below.
</p>
<p>It was at this time that a long suppressed
ambition of Norman and Roy came to the surface.
They wanted a real hunting trip. The
three young men were natural lovers of the open
and curious about animal life in the wilderness.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
But, so far, none of the younger members of
the camp had really had an opportunity to test
himself amid the rigors of a northern winter.
</p>
<p>Colonel Howell finally consented to their leaving
on a hunting expedition that would give
them at least one over-night camp in the snow.
This was on the condition that Philip should
accompany the shooting party and that it should
not proceed over a day&#8217;s march from camp.
</p>
<p>The plan of the hunt was really Roy&#8217;s. He
prepared the provisions and was accepted as
leader of the party.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be any trouble to equip ourselves
like tenderfeet,&#8221; he explained to Colonel
Howell, &#8220;and to make a featherbed trip of this.
But we&#8217;re going to travel like trappers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The hunt was to be for caribou back over the
hills in the direction of the Barren Lands. In
the end Colonel Howell agreed that the party
might advance two days&#8217; travel into the wilderness
but that it must return to camp on the
evening of the fourth day.
</p>
<p>Less than an hour&#8217;s preparation was necessary
and when Philip and the three boys left
camp one morning, the expedition had little
appearance of the usual, heavily laden winter
hunters. Each member of the party was on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
snowshoes, and behind them they drew a small
sled containing their camp equipment. It was
hardly more than a packload for a strong Indian
but the sled was taken in the hope that it might
bring in a return load of fresh meat.
</p>
<p>Philip and Norman carried rifles carefully
protected in mooseskin cases. Paul carried
nothing but his camera and an automatic revolver.
Roy took the first turn at the sled. The
morning was fair but cold, and the bright sun
had no effect upon the snow-laden trees.
</p>
<p>When the enthusiastic hunters reached the
Fort McMurray settlement just below the camp
they left the river and struck inland. Within
an hour they had passed through the pines and
poplars fringing the river and had reached the
summit of a &#8220;hog-back&#8221; range of hills beyond
which there was known to be a little valley running
at right angles to the course of the river.
</p>
<p>When the four travelers reached the top of
the &#8220;hog-back&#8221; and saw the frozen snow-covered
valley before them, like children out for
a lark, Philip no less active than the others,
they coasted into the valley. Until the sun was
high above them they made their way along the
frozen creek toward the head of the wide defile.
About noon, camp was made, tea was brewed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
and, partly behind the protection of a little
frozen waterfall, bannock and cold meat were
added to the hot tea. No time was lost in cooking.
</p>
<p>With faces and ears protected by their heavy
caps, and with heavy mittens to guard their
fingers against frost bite, not one of the party
complained of the intense cold.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; explained Philip, &#8220;unless
the wind comes up, and if it does we&#8217;ll have to
go into camp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But in the valley no wind arose to make any
trouble. The party set forward to reach the
head of the valley before time to go into camp.
They did this by three o&#8217;clock and then, mounting
an elevation and passing through a thin
fringe of dwarf pines, the boys found themselves
on a wind-swept plateau where the snow
clung with difficulty.
</p>
<p>They had seen plenty of deer, rabbits and
small game during the day but had done no
shooting. They were after caribou or moose.
The first look over the desolate plateau, where
not even trees broke the landscape, was far from
inviting. As the sun began to go down and
little was to be seen other than a few rocky
irregularities and a thin covering of snow with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
drifts here and there like white islands, camp
prospects were not as inviting as they had
seemed in the valley behind them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; exclaimed Roy, as the party
paused on the edge of the heights. &#8220;This begins
to look like the real thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe some moose,&#8221; was Philip&#8217;s rejoinder.
&#8220;No moose track on de valley below.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear that?&#8221; exclaimed Roy. &#8220;Everybody
get busy. I reckon we can&#8217;t go any farther
inland to-night than that heap o&#8217; rock way
over there.&#8221; He pointed to a barren elevation
on the already darkening horizon. &#8220;You hunters,&#8221;
he added, indicating Norman and Philip,
&#8220;ought to spread out and look for game tracks
in the swales to the right and left. But don&#8217;t
go too far. Work your way in toward those
rocks before night. You&#8217;ll find us there. Come
on, Paul,&#8221; he added with unusual enthusiasm,
considering that it was rapidly growing colder
in the open country, &#8220;there&#8217;s probably no wood
over there. You and I&#8217;ll get some here and
meet the hunters at the rock pile.&#8221;
</p>
<p>While Norman and the Indian started out,
Roy loosened the axe and drew the sled back
into the pine scrub to look for fallen timber.
This was a tedious process and it was even
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
more of a task to load the firewood onto the
sled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The tent&#8217;ll fix us all right,&#8221; explained Roy
as he backed against the wind and began to
dump his firewood on the snow. &#8220;But first
we&#8217;ve got to make a camp site. Take off your
snowshoes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Where the wind had been cutting over the
tops of the rocks a sort of vacuum had been
formed behind the ridge and into this the snow
had been piled up to a depth of four or five feet.
With a snowshoe, each boy tackled this bank.
Soon they had dug a pit in it about ten by ten
feet. By throwing the loose snow around the
edge of this they created a wall about seven
feet high.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ll show you a trick I read about,&#8221;
exclaimed Roy.
</p>
<p>From the pine grove on the edge of the
plateau he had dragged the slender trunk of a
poplar tree about twelve feet long. This he
now threw over the opening in the snow, making
a sort of a ridge pole, and then with Paul&#8217;s
assistance unrolled the tent and spread it across.
While Paul held the edges of the somewhat
awkward canvas in place on top of the snow
wall Roy piled snow on the ends of the canvas
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
and just as it was too dark to see more the
excavation was thoroughly roofed except in one
corner where the irregular canvas did not fit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We need that for a chimney opening anyway,&#8221;
exclaimed Roy.
</p>
<p>Before a fire could be started, however, there
was the sound of a rifle off to the south, to which
Paul responded with a pistol shot. Then the
camp makers carried their wood into the snow
house and while Paul attended to their scanty
food supply and arranged the sleeping bags as
rugs on the crisp snow floor, Roy started a fire.
The blaze emphasized the darkness without and,
realizing that their companions had no signal,
the two boys split up a torch with the axe and
carried it outside where, while they could keep
it alight, it might serve as a beacon.
</p>
<p>But this was not necessary. Both the Indian
and Norman came in, guided by Paul&#8217;s revolver
shot. Neither reported signs of game. Both
were elated over the house which was already
so warm within that the heavy coats and mittens
could be discarded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose supper&#8217;s all ready,&#8221; exclaimed
Norman after he had got his numbed limbs
warmed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Roy, &#8220;I&#8217;ve just been waiting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
for you so we could have it all fresh and hot.
I&#8217;m going to prepare it myself and everything&#8217;s
going to be in trapper style. It won&#8217;t be much
but it&#8217;s all you need and it&#8217;s according to the
rules and regulations. I&#8217;ve already got my hot
water. Now I&#8217;ll get the bannocks ready.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you bring those I made for you?&#8221;
asked Philip, the camp cook and hunter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I prefer to make &#8217;em myself,&#8221; answered
Roy, &#8220;just as the Indians make &#8217;em in the
woods.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Philip smiled and Norman and Paul looked
somewhat disappointed but neither made objection.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s my flour,&#8221; explained Roy who had
already rolled up his sweater sleeves and produced
an old flour bag with a few pounds of
flour in the bottom of it. &#8220;I mixed the baking
powder with the flour before we left camp so as
to save time,&#8221; he explained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to me we&#8217;ve got all night,&#8221; interrupted
Norman. &#8220;They don&#8217;t do that to save
time&mdash;you&#8217;re mixed. They do that to save
carrying the baking powder in a separate package.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway,&#8221; retorted Roy, &#8220;it&#8217;s the way real
trappers do.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>He had rolled the sides of the sack down to
make a kind of receptacle at the bottom of which
lay his flour. Then with a piece of wood he
pried off the top of the tea kettle and was about
to pour some boiling water onto the flour when
Philip with a grunt stopped him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Non,&#8221; exclaimed the Indian. &#8220;You spoil
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Over Roy&#8217;s feeble protest the Indian scooped
up snow and deposited it in the boiling water
until the fluid was somewhat cooler. Then he
passed the kettle to the waiting Roy who began
to mix his Indian bread. But had Philip
allowed Roy to proceed in his generous application
of water, his proposed bannocks would have
resulted in flour paste. In the end, because
Roy had to get his pork ready, the volunteer
cook permitted Philip to finish the fashioning of
a bannock as big as the frying pan,&mdash;the only
cooking utensil that Roy had thought necessary
to bring with them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; exclaimed Roy, as he deposited a
generous piece of salt pork in the frying pan,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you how the hungry trapper makes
a supper fit for a king.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As the pork began to sizzle in the pan those
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
who were eagerly watching the amateur cook
saw the piece separating into thin sections.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, that&#8217;s what we trappers always
do,&#8221; explained Roy rather proudly. &#8220;You
can&#8217;t slice pork when it&#8217;s frozen solid. I sliced
my pork before we left camp this morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>By this time the rashers of pork were swimming
about in the hot fat like doughnuts in bubbling
lard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly smells all right,&#8221; exclaimed
Paul, as the appetizing odor from the frying
meat filled the snow cave. &#8220;Hurry up and give
us a piece.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Roy made no reply but busied himself stirring
the bits of meat with the point of his knife.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the bread ready?&#8221; the cook asked, turning
to Philip.
</p>
<p>The Indian only pointed to the big ball of
dough flattened out like a gigantic pancake and
ready for the skillet.
</p>
<p>There upon Roy seized the handle of his frying
pan, shifted the skillet to one side and, resting
it on the snow, began to flip the bits of salt
pork onto the snow floor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, what are you doing?&#8221; shouted Norman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t eat those scraps,&#8221; announced
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
Roy positively. &#8220;The only good in pork is the
fat and the fat&#8217;s all in the skillet. We trappers
give these scraps to the dogs&mdash;only we ain&#8217;t
got any dogs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well I&#8217;ll be a dog all right,&#8221; exclaimed
Norman and as fast as Roy flipped the brown
rashers out with his knife point Norman and
Paul grabbed them up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t any need of doin&#8217; that,&#8221; snorted
Roy. &#8220;I tell you there ain&#8217;t any good in those
things and it&#8217;s against all the rules anyhow.
You&#8217;ll get all the fat you want when our bannock&#8217;s
done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, why don&#8217;t you start it?&#8221; asked
Paul. &#8220;I suppose it&#8217;ll take it an hour to cook.
And your fat&#8217;s getting cold anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where you show your ignorance,&#8221;
retorted Roy. &#8220;I suppose you fellows think I
don&#8217;t know my business. If I&#8217;d put that bannock
right into this hot fat it would have fried
like a doughnut. I&#8217;ve got to get this grease
soaked up in my bread. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m lettin&#8217;
the grease get cool.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With this he took the flat looking loaf from
the Indian&#8217;s hands and slipped it into the already
nearly full frying pan. But Roy knew
his limitations. As he lifted the pan back upon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
the coals and the grease began to sizzle and snap
he knew that he had exhausted his culinary
knowledge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; he said to the Indian, &#8220;you can
watch this while it cooks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a smile the Indian took the handle of
the pan, shook it deftly a few times, lifted the
edge of the dough with skilled fingers and then
settled the pan upon a bed of coals just outside
the heart of the fire and, squatted by its side,
carefully watched the baking. Meanwhile, Norman
and Paul were crunching bacon scraps
while Roy was mopping his perspiring brow
with the sleeve of his sweater.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s all we&#8217;re going to have,&#8221; broke
in Norman, &#8220;I want to go home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But that was all they did have. The conscientious
Roy, who had given the subject much
consideration, had carefully refrained from
bringing any luxuries other than tea and a little
sugar. But by the time the bannock was done&mdash;and
the Indian knew how to cook it&mdash;the
three boys had become so hungry that the Indian
bread was eaten ravenously. Then the party
crept into their sleeping bags at an early hour
and passed the night without discomfort.
</p>
<p>Philip took charge of the camp in the morning
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
and before the boys crept out of their bags
he served each of them with a cup of hot tea.
When the boys looked outside of their snow tent
it seemed hardly dawn and yet it was after eight
o&#8217;clock. Philip shook his head and announced
prospects of bad weather. There was no sun
and, although it was no colder than it had been
the day before, there was a gloom over all that
suggested a storm.
</p>
<p>Not one of the boys would have suggested it
but the Indian did not hesitate to warn them
that they should return to the camp at once.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how I would vote on this
question,&#8221; said Norman, &#8220;if we&#8217;d had proper
provisions. But I don&#8217;t propose to live three
more days on the <i>ghost</i> of salt pork. And, besides,
we&#8217;ve got plenty of moose meat in camp.
I&#8217;m not so keen about going to the Barren Lands
as I was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was why late that afternoon Colonel
Howell was both surprised and glad to see his
young friends trot into camp.

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE <i>Gitchie Manitou</i> WINS A RACE</h3>
</div>

<p>Norman and Roy soon became restless and
after a few days&#8217; idleness asked Colonel Howell
for permission to make their delayed visit to
the Pointe aux Tremble Indian camp. The day
set for this second relief expedition promised
a continuation of clear dry weather. Almost
duplicating their last provisions, the monoplane
got away at dawn. At the last moment, Paul
was substituted for Roy, and he and Norman
made an uneventful flight directly up the river.
This time a landing was made at the foot of the
bluff on the smooth ice of the river. The provisions
were distributed and then the two boys
visited the cabin of the paralytic Indian.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Chandler probably will be out running his
trap line,&#8221; suggested Norman, &#8220;but he may be
at home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Within the cabin they found only the Indian.
To Norman&#8217;s surprise, the rusty traps still hung
on the wall, with no sign of having been touched
since he and Roy visited the cabin. Norman&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
observing eye at once examined the other parts
of the room.
</p>
<p>In the bunk corner there was absolutely no
change. He would have sworn that Chandler
had not slept in the place since he returned. A
sudden suspicion coming into Norman&#8217;s mind,
he walked to the bunk corner of the room and
pointed to the crevice from which they had
taken the letter. The Indian grinned. Then
Norman pointed to the curing boards, made
motions with his hands to indicate a man of
about Chandler&#8217;s build and other pantomimes
of inquiry. The Indian responded with his
usual grin, then shook his head. Norman&#8217;s jaw
dropped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Paul,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;we&#8217;re a lot of
chumps. Chandler never came back to this
camp. He hired the best dog team in this part
of the world and while we were all asleep he&#8217;s
been hurrying to Edmonton. He&#8217;s had seven
days&#8217; start, and the way these dogs travel, he&#8217;ll
cover that distance in jig time. Come on,&#8221; he
almost shouted, &#8220;we&#8217;ve got something to do
now besides feeding lazy Indians. The hunters
are back, anyway, and there won&#8217;t be any starving
around here. We&#8217;ve got to get back to
Colonel Howell as fast as the airship&#8217;ll go.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></p>
<p>Philip&#8217;s supper was awaiting the return of
the <i>Gitchie Manitou</i>, but its serving was long
delayed. For an hour the conference that took
place immediately upon the safe housing of the
monoplane continued while each participant contributed
his views. The conclusion was inevitable.
Colonel Howell must proceed to Edmonton
at once. There was a discussion as to
whether this perilous flight should be made to
Athabasca Landing, where Colonel Howell
would have to make the last hundred miles of
journey by train, or whether the trip through
the Arctic skies should be made by compass
directly to Edmonton.
</p>
<p>Finally it was decided, in view of the comprehensive
charts that they had of the intervening
country, that the latter should be the program,
even if it were necessary to make a landing on
the way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The trains from Athabasca Landing,&#8221; concluded
Colonel Howell at last, &#8220;run only three
times a week, and I&#8217;m not sure of the schedule.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; announced Norman, &#8220;we&#8217;ll do it
by <i>Air Line</i>. We can make it, if you want to
trust me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s worth while,&#8221; laughed the
colonel.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t much time,&#8221; broke in the excited
Roy. &#8220;They&#8217;ve had good hard snow, and
this half-breed&#8217;s got a great team, I understand.
If they made forty miles a day, and I&#8217;ve heard
o&#8217; them doing that, you&#8217;ll have to get a hustle
on you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We leave to-night,&#8221; announced Norman,
springing to his feet. &#8220;Philip!&#8221; he called.
</p>
<p>Colonel Howell, with a disturbed look on his
face, interrupted:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we leave in the morning&mdash;early?&#8221;
he suggested. &#8220;I think I&#8217;d rather ride
by daylight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll feel more comfortable by night,&#8221;
laughed Paul, &#8220;and you don&#8217;t need to miss your
sleep. Norman won&#8217;t have any use for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The discussion did not close for some time
after this and when supper was finally served,
the last detail had been arranged. The meal
proceeded without any sign of the momentous
event to follow. At its conclusion, Colonel
Howell turned to Ewen and Miller and said,
almost nonchalantly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys, I&#8217;m going to leave you for a few days.
Your friend Chandler is on his way to Edmonton
to make trouble for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Both men looked startled and Ewen exclaimed:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The same thing he wanted you boys to do
and in which you wouldn&#8217;t join him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Miller managed to
ask.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What you wrote him a letter about,&#8221; answered
Colonel Howell calmly. &#8220;I read that.
But,&#8221; he went on, as both men gave new signs
of alarm, &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to forget it. Do you men
want to go on working for me as you have in the
past?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Flushed faces made any other answer unnecessary.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; continued Colonel Howell,
&#8220;then that&#8217;s settled. But I want you to get
Chandler out of your systems. You can stay
here. To show you that I trust you, I&#8217;m going
to leave you in the camp again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Immediately, activity began; Norman and
Roy working on the <i>Gitchie Manitou</i>, the half-breed
preparing supplies, and Colonel Howell
making notes and getting papers together on the
still littered table.
</p>
<p>On an air line, the young aviators estimated
the distance across country at about two hundred
and seventy miles. After a consultation it
was decided to proceed at the rate of about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
thirty-five miles an hour. This meant eight
hours in the air. As there was no need of
reaching the distant city before eight o&#8217;clock,
it was agreed to start at midnight. At seven
o&#8217;clock, all preparations having been made, Norman
turned in for a few hours&#8217; sleep.
</p>
<p>Colonel Howell devoted some time to his
private arrangements and spent the remainder
of the evening discussing the flight with the
other occupants of the cabin. Norman being
sound asleep at twelve o&#8217;clock, the others agreed
not to arouse him for another hour, considering
the work he had done that day. But at one
o&#8217;clock new activity began.
</p>
<p>A match was again applied to the gas well
and the monoplane was whirled out into the
spectacular illumination. There could be only
a brief handshake all around. Then, without
a slip, the monoplane was off in the light of the
waning moon.
</p>
<p>Least of all did the voyagers suffer from the
keen cold. With a plentiful store of gasoline,
the heaters were at once started but in a short
time Colonel Howell asked Norman to shut off
one of them. The passenger had been assigned
the duty of watching the engine gauge and recording
it, together with the chronometer record.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
Norman did not find this necessary but it
was a check upon his own observations and a
safeguard against errors in noting their progress.
</p>
<p>It was too dark for the colonel to feel any
sense of apprehension. As there was no wind,
the conditions were ideal for an aerial flight, and
Norman having once shaped his course, the
powerful car sped on its way as if sliding downhill.
In time the monotonous whir of the propellers
appeared to have its effect upon Colonel
Howell, and Norman caught him dozing more
than once. He then explained to his passenger
that his observations were no longer necessary
and persuaded Colonel Howell to wrap up in
his blanket and go to sleep.
</p>
<p>When the passenger aroused himself, about
five o&#8217;clock, Norman asked him to make some
tea and see what Philip had prepared in the way
of food. It was his only way of relaxing under
the strain and he ate heartily. Later, Colonel
Howell again pulled his blankets about him and
did not stir until the gray of the winter dawn
was in the air. The moon had long since disappeared
but the stars were brilliant.
</p>
<p>When the land beneath came into view, the
oil prospector took his place in front of the port
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
section for his first view of the world from the
clouds. Then day came and the east grew red.
No settlement was yet in sight, but as the golden
sun began to glisten on the snow-weighted trees,
Colonel Howell gave an exclamation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the railroad!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;We&#8217;re
crossing it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just after eight o&#8217;clock,&#8221; muttered Norman,
as he craned his neck to make out the land
beneath. &#8220;We&#8217;re certainly this side o&#8217; the
town and we&#8217;ll take to the tracks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With this, he brought the steady airship about
and began to follow the rails, which were now
plain enough below. For another quarter of an
hour, the monoplane made its way steadily to
the south and then a sudden blur broke the landscape
in the distance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There she is,&#8221; remarked Norman, almost
casually. &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget your packages and
bundles.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At nine o&#8217;clock Colonel Howell and Norman
were eating breakfast at the Royal George
Hotel. At half past ten they were leaving the
big new Provincial Capitol Building. The
colonel had filed his claims and had his papers
safely in his pocket. A little later, entering the
busy hotel office once more, Norman hastily
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
caught his patron&#8217;s sleeve. Seated in front of
the hotel fireplace, as if gratefully drinking in
its warmth, was the worn and emaciated Chandler.
By his side was Fosseneuve the half-breed,
already far gone in intoxication.
</p>
<p>Colonel Howell stepped forward, as if about
to speak to the defeated man. Then he paused.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t do any good,&#8221; he exclaimed in an
undertone to Norman. &#8220;We got there first.
And he might have beaten us at that if he hadn&#8217;t
stopped here in the hotel too long. We&#8217;ll take
the afternoon train down to Calgary for a day&#8217;s
visit. Then, when you&#8217;re ready, we&#8217;ll go back
to the boys.&#8221;
